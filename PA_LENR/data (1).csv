The sudden discharge of fracture energy during crack propagation generates considerable heat. The abundance of deuterium in cracked palladium will not continue the heat-generation process. The confident figures-of-merit of cold fusion have been based on the small energy input to the electrolytic cells and do not consider the substantial energy required to process (by melting) the palladium from the ore, or to recycle the cracked electrode samples.

This question is normally asked in the context of the statement that Quantum Mechanics shows that this phenomenon is impossible (a view that we share). Our answer is always based on the statement 'but what about the modelling of such systems in terms of QED?' which is always met by the insistence that Quantum Mechanics shows that Cold Fusion is impossible. We conclude that scientists do not understand QED or, if they have some understanding of this subject, then this must be subject to some major misconceptions. This pointless dialogue (perhaps more correctly described as two monologues conducted in parallel) and the insistence on the primacy of Quantum Mechanics in the modelling of systems in the Natural Sciences is unfortunate because it obscures the outcome of the investigations in the more normal fields of the Natural Sciences (more normal than Cold Fusion). A brief outline of the work which has led to the formulation of the concept of coherence will therefore be given under the aegis of the revolutions in our understanding of the Natural Sciences which has taken place since the latter part of the 19. Century. The main illustration of the way we can demonstrate the applicability of these concepts will be based on the study of nucleation and phase growth. The development of micro-electrode substrates allows us to study the statistics of the formation of the first nucleus; it will be shown that these statistics are strictly in line with concepts developed from QED coherence. We conclude that QED coherence is not just a concept to be confined to sub-atomic physics, cosmology etc. but that it pervades the modelling of the whole of the Natural Sciences including that of 'Cold Fusion'.

The hydrogen Binuclear Atom, a model proposed 25 years ago, is a metastable configuration in which the two nuclei are held together at a very short distance in an atom-like configuration. This should be a distinctive configuration of the hydrogen molecule where nuclei are characterized by a high kinetic energy, and nuclear motion is coupled with electronic motion. This is a completely different model from the usual Born-Oppenheimer picture of atoms and molecules we are used to, where nuclei oscillate about their equilibrium positions and electronic motion is decoupled from the nuclear one. The identification of helium-like hydrogen spectra and ultra-dense hydrogen as Binuclear Atoms has a strong impact on one of the main objections to Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR): the overcoming of the Coulomb barrier thus identifying a sound mechanism for the occurrence of LENR.  This work is not  conclusive.

1. Introduction
The investigation of extreme states of matter under extremely high compression is
one of the most important areas of fundamental science. Especially important and
interestingisthesearchforwaystoform“stellar”states ofmatter,withparameters
closetothosewhichoccurinastrophysicalobjectssuchaswhitedwarfsandneutron

predict the anomalousproperties of boththe very process ofsupercompression and
the synthesized superdense matter, includingthe possibilityofgreat energy release

of radioactive nuclei, and the formationof superheavy quasistable nuclei.
Theproblemsofformationofextreme statesofmatter,anditsuseinsolvingthe

priority directions of the activity of a specialized laboratory for electrodynamical
studies of the “Proton-21” firm established in Kiev in 1999.

2. Facilities, methods, and main results of experiments
2.1. Facility
In the course of creation of the experimental base of the laboratory, the best
availablemethods for extremely strong matter compression were employed. At the
same time, while designing the experimental setup, a special emphasis was put on
the realizationof scientific ideas developed by the creative staff and the laboratory
1
administration. Weposedthe problemofcreatingasetup whichisabletoensure a
high energy concentration (from acoherent driver) in asolidtarget (with size of at
most 10–100µm) in the first stage ofthe impulse process. At the second stage, the
further self-supporting compression of this region up to a state of collapse on the
subangstrom-scale, and the attainment of the “stellar” matter state should occur.
In the experimental setup (see Figure 1),animpulse electron beamwith atotal
energy ofatmost1kJ wasused as acoherent driver ineach cycle ofsupercompres-
sion(aschematic ofthe basicexperiment under discussioninthispaper isshownin
Figure 2). Both the compressed target, and the driver system ensuring the super-
compression, were in a vacuum system. This guarantees maximumpurity, control
1,2
over experiments, their reproducibility.
The expected results concerning matter supercompression were derived on 24
February 2000.
The optimizedstructure ofthe experimental setup allowsus to perform atleast
10 different experiments on the supercompression of different targets in a day. At
present, the total number of experiments exceeds 5000. As target materials, we
have used practicallyallchemicalelements fromwhich onecan manufactureasolid495

In the implementation of the element and isotope analyses, the followingmethods
based on relevant facilitieswere used:
• Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA)—analyzer REMMA 102 (Ukraine).
• Auger-electron spectroscopy (AES)—Auger spectroscope JAMP-10S (JEON,
Japan).
• Secondary ion mass-spectrometry (SIMS)—SIMS analyzer IMS 4f (Cameca,
France).
• Laser mass-spectrometry (LMS).
• Integralthermalionmass-spectrometry (TIMS)—thermal ionmass-spectroscope
“Finnigan MAT-262.”
• Glowdischarge mass-spectrometer VG 9000 (Thermo Elemental,UK).
• Rutherford backscattering of accelerated α-particles (RBS).
All together, more than 15000 element and isotope analyses were performed, in-
cluding those listed in Table 1:
2.3. Observations
During the experiments (on solid target supercompression to the collapsed state),
several anomalousphenomena were observed:
• In the process of the collapse formation, and during its subsequent evolution for
100ns, intense x-ray and gamma radiation (in the energy range from2–3 keVto
10 MeV, with a maximum near 30 keV). The total radiation dose in the range
30–100keVexceeded 50–100 krad at a distance of10 cmfrom the active region.497
• Synthesis oflight, medium,and heavy chemicalelements and isotopes (with 1≤
A≤240);andfusionofsuperheavy transuraniumelements(with250≤A≤500)
in the area near the collapse zone. Some ofthese results are considered below.
• All of the created elements and isotopes were stable (without alpha, beta, or
gamma activities).
• Transformationofanyradioactivenucleitostablenucleiinthecollapsezone. The
utilizationefficiencyofradionuclides per 1kJ ofthedriverenergy corresponds to
18 60
the transmutation of about 10 target nuclei (e.g. Co) into nonradioactive
isotopes ofother nuclei.
• Unique spatial distribution of different chemical elements and isotopes (with
1 ≤ A ≤ 240) in the volume of an accumulating screen, which was made of a
chemically pure element and which was remote from the collapse zone (all the
createdelementsandisotopesweresituatedinthesamethinlayer,orseveralthin
layers, inside ofthe screen).
2.4. Results due to a new physical process
These results indicate that a previously unknown physical process, namely the
artificially-induced collapse of part of the target material, was realized at our lab-
oratory for the first time. In every experiment, the collapse is completed by both
the fullnuclear regeneration of a portion of the initialsubstance of the target with
a mass of 0.5–1 mg and the formation of artificially derived chemical elements in-
steadoftheinitialatoms,includingthelong-livedandstableisotopesofsuperheavy
chemical elements which are not found on earth or in near space.
Thesephenomenacanbeinterpreted(withahighprobability)onthebasisofthe
idea of the creation and evolution of a self-organizing and self-supporting collapse
state of the electron-nucleus plasma (of an initial solid substance); to a state of
electron-nucleus clusters (with the density close to that of the nuclear substance)
under the action of a coherent driver. During the evolution of such a collapse, the
processes of fast fusion and creation of different isotopes (including trarnsuranium
ones), take place. After the end of the collapse, synthesized isotopes were detected
nearthecollapsezone,onthesurface andinthevolumeoftheremoteaccumulating
screen.
It was also suggested that, during the evolution of this cluster, the process of
emission of superheavy neutral nuclear clusters with A>3000–5000takes place.

and isotopicanomalies. The measurements were carried outat the institutes ofthe
National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine; at the Taras Shevchenko Kiev National
University; at one of the leading enterprises of the Ministry of Atomic Industry of

After the implementation of every experiment, many chemical elements (with
atomic numbers both greater and smaller than those ofinitialchemicallypure ma-
terial) wasmeasured onthe target surface, andon the surface andinthe volumeof
accumulating screens. This amount is much larger than that of admixtures in the
initialmaterials of the target and accumulating screens (see, e.g. Table 2).
Forthe majorityofthe synthesized chemicalelements, we observed asignificant
deviation from the natural isotope ratio. For many elements, this ratio is changed
by5–100times(itcanincrease ordecrease). Fig. 3showsanexampleofachangein

These precautions enable us to assert that we detected nonidentified stable
atomic masses in the transuranium region with 250 < A < 500 on the samples
located near the action zone of the coherent driver. After every experiment, about
10–20 types of superhigh masses (superheavy nuclei) were measured; moreover, a
7 10
representative number of superheavy nuclei of each type equaled 10 to 10 . The
number of superheavy nuclei formed increases with use of a target made of heavy
atoms (e.g. Pb). Most frequently are registered superheavy nuclei with A = 271,
272, 330, 341, 343, 394, 433. The same superheavy nuclei were registered on the
same samples during repeated measurements over time intervals of a few months.
4. Spatial distribution
4.1. Anomalous atom distributions
Whileinvestigatingthespatialdistributionofproducts ofthenucleosynthesisinthe
volumeofaccumulatingscreens made ofchemicallypure materials(mainlyCu),we
found alien chemical elements (from H to Pb) in the amount which exceeded their
initialtotalamountintheformofadmixturesbyseveralorders (Table2). Allthese
elements were positioned in several thin concentric layers. The first (superficial)
layer, about 200 ˚A thick, contained about 3× 1018 atoms of all elements. The
second was located at a depth X ≈ 0.3 µm, and contained about 1018 atoms.
And the third was at X ≈ 7 µm. At the same time, we found a decrease in the
concentration of the initialmaterial of a target in the volumes of these layers.
Letusconsiderpossiblemechanismsfortheformationofathinlayer(containing
different elements and isotopes withthe same spatialdistribution)inthe volumeof

by ionic etching the surface of an accumulating screen with an ion microprobe
analyzer Cameca IMS 4f. One can see in Fig. 6 that different chemical elements
(e.g. Au, Pr, La,I, Ce, W,andunidentified element
156A)
are situated in the same
thin layer (with relative thickness ∆R/R ≈ 0.25 and distance R = Xcosθ from
the surface intothe depth ofthe accumulatingscreen inthe direction outwards the
collapse zone). The distance R and thickness ∆R are the same for the whole layer
and all chemical elements for a single experiment. For different experiments, the
values of R and ∆R may be different, but the ratio ∆R/R is the same.
The synthesized elements and isotopes were distributed over the layer surface
as separate clusters. At the center of the screen, the clusters overlapped. Cluster
distributions for Al,B,Si,and K on the layersurface are presented in Fig. 7. Note
that the distributions are the same in all details. This result can be obtained only
if alldetected elements were born in each cluster during the nuclear transmutation
of unknown particles.
Itiseasytomakesurethatsuchdistributionsoverthesurfaceandradiuscannot
be a result of the ordinary process of Coulomb deceleration for different fast ions.

different charges. On the other hand, for different ions at the same energy E, the
ratio of deceleration distances R i is also very high (e.g. for H+ and Pb+ , we have
R H/R Pb > 20–30).
The total number of alien atoms considerably exceeded that of the starting ad-
mixture; therefore, such a unique distribution cannot be created by the nonlinear
waves of admixtures which are observed sometimes in nonequlibrium processes. In
addition, the three-dimensional character of the anomalous distribution of synthe-
sized chemicalelements (different elements were located insmallcoincident regions
on the surfaces of concentration layers) cannot be explained by the processes of
transport or diffusion as well.
The observed distribution of chemical elements (the fixed values of ∆R and R
fordifferent particlesineachsingleexperiment) inthe layermayappearonlyinthe
case of deceleration in the depth of the screen of identical particles with the same
charge and energy. But such a distribution is observed for different elements (from
H to Pb)! So, we are faced with a paradox in this case.
We suppose that such a distribution of different chemical elements and isotopes is
possible only if the followingconditions are met:
(1) Allinitial(decelerated and stopped) particles must be the same (identical).
(2) Forthestabilityofthechargeofparticles,theirvelocitiesV mustbelowerrelative
to the velocity v 0=e2 /(cid:1)=2.5×108 cm/s ofvalence electrons.
(3) Foralargedistance ofdecelerationRatalowvelocityV (cid:2)v 0,themassM ofan
unknown particle must be very large.503
(4) Different chemical elements and isotopes observed in the screen layer are created
by the nuclear transmutation of these identicalparticles after stopping at R.
What is the nature of these unknown superheavy particles and the mechanism of
the fastnuclear transmutationto different finalstable nuclei? Thisproblem willbe
discussed below.
4.2. Deceleration of heavy particles by elastic scattering
We have investigated the possible mechanism of elastic deceleration of these un-
known particles, and we have calculated their parameters. The equation of motion
of the unknown uncharged particles with mass M in the bulk of the screen is the
following:

Let us make numerical estimates. For a screen made of chemically pure cop-
per (A 0 ≈ 63 − 65), the concentration and elastic scattering cross section are
n ≈ 8×1022 cm−3 and σ ≈ 10−16 cm2 , respectively. With an experimental value
of the distance of deceleration R(τ) ≈ 0.4 µm and at T 0 =300 K = 0.025eV, and
T= 35keV,wehavethevery largemassoftheunknownparticle: M ≈91M 0,A≈
91A 0 ≈ 5700. The initialvelocity of these superheavy particles was low relative to
the velocityofthe valenceelectrons (v 0 =e2/(cid:1)=2.5×108 cm/s),and wasequalto
V(0)=(3T/M)1/2≈3.7×106
cm/s. The total duration of particle deceleration is
τ ≈0.8×10−9 s. In adifferent case (e.g. for alayer situated ata different distance
of deceleration R(τ) ≈ 7 µm), we have M ≈ 1540M 0 and A ≈ 1540A 0 ≈ 100000.
The obtained parameters correspond to requirements (1–3).
5. Possible model for evolution of neutralized superheavy nuclei
We assume that these superheavy particles are similar to abnormal superheavy
5,6
neutralized nuclei that were proposed by A. Migdal about 20 years ago. Migdal
obtainedthe importantresult consistinginthattheenergy E/Aofthe nuclearsub-
stance hastwominima(thefirst“ordinary”atA ≈ 60,andthesecond“abnormal”
at A max ≥2×105 ). Migdal suggested that the presence of the second “abnormal”
minimum of energy E/A was a result of the Fermi condensation of pions in the
volume of superheavy nucleus (e.g. during the action of a shock). These minima
are separated by a high potential barrier at Z 0 ≈ ((cid:1)c/e2 )3/2 ≈ 1600. The mech-
anism for the suppression of the action of that barrier will be discussed below. If505

this hypothesis is correct, then superheavy neutralized nuclei created in the active
zone of a coherent driver can absorb environmental “ordinary”nuclei of the target
(screen). This transmutation leads to a growth of these superheavy neutralized
nuclei by nuclear fusion up to A max.
Very few electrons are outside the volume of these nuclei in a thin skin with
−12
thickness about 10 cm. The probability of such a synthesis is very high due to
the high transparency of the Coulomb barrier. Energy is released during such a
fusion reaction. Different channels are availablefor the release of the excess energy
(gammaemission,theemissionofneutrons andnuclearfragments,etc.). Oneofthe
channelsisconnected withthecreationofdifferent“normal”nuclei,andthemission
ofthesenucleifromthevolumeofagrowingsuperheavynucleus. Forexample,after
the absorption of several target nuclei with A T ≈ 50−200 in a short time, a high
binding energy can lead to the emission of several light nuclei with A L < A T, or
one heavy nucleus with A H ≈300−−500>A T (see Fig. 8).
The process of nucleus emission competes with other ways for cooling the nu-
clear substance. In this case, usual even–even nuclei (like the alpha particle, and
C12 , O16 ,..., Pb208 ) which already exist in the volume of a superheavy nucleus,
are more likely to emerge and be emitted. In fact, every superheavy nucleus is a
“specific microreactor” for the transmutation of “normal”target nuclei to different
configurations of nucleons. In this microreactor, the transmutation process termi-
nates afterthe utilizationofalltarget nuclei, orafter the evolutionofasuperheavy

of the coherent driver. It follows from our calculation that for some usual (not
superheavys) but “critical” nuclei (e.g. at Z > Z cr ≈ 92) at special parameters of
the coherent driver, the process offast and self-controllingchange (decrease) ofthe
energy of nucleons (an increase in the binding energy) takes place. The value Z cr
depends on the driver parameters. For a more intense driver, Z cr will be less. It
also follows that the minimum of this energy is changed in time from the initial
(usual) value at A opt ≈ 60 to A opt ≥ 104 . All “subcritical” nuclei with Z < Z cr
have stable minimum of energy at A opt ≈ 60. This effect is connected with the
self-similar processes in the superdense degenerate electron-nucleon plasma with a
suppressed influence of the Coulomb interaction between protons in the volume of
a superheavy nucleus. The coherent driver should start this self-amplifyingprocess
of nuclear transformation for “critical” nuclei.
We have calculated the energy change per nucleon (E/A) for different relations
of the electron and proton concentrations for “critical” nuclei at 30<A< 2×105 .
During the initial phase of the process (at the shift of the minimum of the energy
per nucleon E/A to A opt ≈ 5000−−10,000), the role of pionic condensation is
slight, but it becomes critical at A opt ≥ 105 . The degenerate electron-nucleus
plasma initiallyincludes a mixture of all nuclei (normal stable nuclei, and growing
superheavy ones) and electrons, and is prevented from decaying due to the action
(pressure) ofthecoherentdriver. Thedescriptionofsuchprocesses willbepresented507
elsewhere.
Duringsuch achange oftheE/Aratioforsuperheavy nuclei,the fusionprocess
for target nuclei (the absorptionof target nuclei with“subcritical charge” Z <Z cr,
and the growthof“critical”nucleiwith Z >Z cr)inthe action zone ofthe coherent
driver becomes possible (see Fig. 9). This fusion leads to a fast growth of initial
“critical”nuclei upto A ≈ 104 –105 duringthe action timeofthe coherent driver
(about ∆t d ≤ 100 ns) with velocity (dA/dt)collapse ≈ A/∆t d ≈ 1012 to 1013 s−1 .
This velocity is proportional to the concentration of nuclei in the target. This
process may lead to the creation of nuclei with 1<A<300−500. The scheme of
creation of these nuclei and the scheme reviewed above during the analysis of the
processes occurring in the accumulatingscreen are the same.
Aftertheterminationofthecompressingactionofacoherent driver,theprocess
of decay of the degenerate electron-nucleus plasma, which includes the mixture of
allnuclei(normalstablenucleiofthetarget,growingsuperheavynuclei,andcreated
nuclei) due to nuclear reactions, takes place. Some of these superheavy nuclei hit
the remote accumulating screen and are decelerated there.
The growthvelocityofthese nucleiinthe volumeofasolidaccumulatingscreen

transmutation of nuclear subsystem in such collapse area are presented in [7-9].

1. Parameters of magneto-charged particle
Inourprevious work[1,2] it was shownthat theprocess of formationofperiodictracks is
connected withamagneticinteractionofmagneto-chargedparticlewithbothmagnetic fieldof
anodecurrent andmultilayerMDS structure,whichis thecombinationof diamagnetics (Si,SiO
andmeltedionizedAl)andparamagnetic(solidAl)layers. Inviewoftheform ofamacrotrack
(involvingthe great numberofstrictlyperiodicoscillations [1,2]),wemayconcludethat the
controllingmagnetic fieldis approximatelythesamealongtheentiretrajectory.This
corresponds tothe fact that formationdurationof mentionedtrackpart is significantlyless than
thetotal duration 50ns ofthecurrent pulse. Ifthis durationwas comparablewith ,thenthe
periodofoscillations at thebeginningandat the endofthetrack wouldbe essentiallydifferent.
This result allows us toassumethat thedurationoftheformationofthis part ofthetrack with
thelength L2mm is t  5ns, andthemeanlongitudinal velocityofmotionofthe
hypothetical magneto-chargedparticle<v >is greaterthan L/t 4.107cm/s.

There aretwopossibleways for generation(creation)ofsuchparticles duringthe experiments
in“Proton-21” Lab:
31. These monopoles were created during nuclear processes of protonization and neutronization
in collapse zone with the presence of very strong squeezed nonuniform magnetic field in the
experimental setup of ""Proton21"" Lab. Fundamental nuclear transformation in this setup
during the formation (shock implosion) and explosion of this zone is described in [3, 5-7]. A
specific mechanism of the generation of magnetic charge can be related with the topological
features ofthecollapsezone.

Surface segregation was observed in samples that were essentially α-phase materials,i.e., high-purity commercial α-Ti, Ti-6A1, and Ti-3A1-2.5V, whereas Ti-6A1-4V had slight enrichment and β-Ti-13Mn had no detectable segregation. Nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) techniques were used to measure the near-surface deuterium concentration, and the segregation has been localized to within 50 nm of the surface. The time-dependent increase of deuterium at the surface is consistent with deuterium diffusion from the bulk to the surface and a room-temperature diffusivity of approximately 3 × 10-9 cm2/s. Surface enrichment in excess of 30 times the bulk concentration was observed in charged samples and in excess of 60 times for samples that had been charged and then vacuum annealed. Polishing was found to be of importance in causing segregation. The presence of deuterides or a surface defect state is suggested to explain the deuterium surface enrichment.","Adler, P.

INTRODUCTION
Fleischmann,Pons andHawkins (1)andJones et al. (2)havereported evidencefor
nuclear fusionofdeuterium electro-chemicallyinjectedintopalladium.Excess heat
generation,neutronand γ-rays emissionandtritium enhancement (1)were foundbythe
first group andneutron emission(2)bythesecond group.Theseresults havebeenmet
withmuchskepticism,especiallyafterseveral reports ofnegativeresults byother
workers (3-5).Subsequentlytherehavebeenanumberofreports ofexcess heat
generation(6-8)andtritium enhancement (9, 10) orboth (11).
Thepresent research was motivatedbythenecessityfor experiments under well
definedconditions. Inordertoverifyexcess heat generationcalorimetric measurements
weredonewithamodified(Fleischmann-Pons)typeopencell andcalorimetric
measurements witha closedcell withinternal D /O recombination.Someexcess heat
2 2
generationwas observed. Theresults, however,requirefurtherevaluationandwill be
reported at afuturedate. Careful determinationof tritium was doneinelectrolytic
solutionandalso inthewaterobtained from therecombined gases outside thecell.
Surface analysis ofPdcathodewas performed and theD/Pdratiodetermined.Neutron
radiationmeasurements were attempted,but difficulties inmakingbackground
corrections interferedwiththeinterpretation.EXPERIMENTAL
Electrodes
Pdfrom several sources was usedfor cathodes. Therods 0.2 ×10cm were obtained
from EngelhardCorporation.Wireof0.5mm diameterand99.9%purity, was obtained
from Johnson Matthey- Aesar.1mm wire(grade A)and4mm rodof99.9%puritywere
obtainedfrom Johnson-Matthey,England.TheEngelhardPdwas also usedby
Westinghousetoprepare 2mm rods byrecasting, drawingorswaging.The pre-
treatments usedwithvarious samples areindicatedinthetables.
Anodes weremadeofEngelhard's Pt ribbonorwirecages of99.9%purityPt orNi foil
(99.9%),obtained from FischerScientificCo.
Electrolytes
0.1M LiODwas usedas theelectrolyteinall glass cells, while0.1M and1 M LiOD
wereusedinNi encased cells. LiODattacks glass, whichleads toadepositionofSi and
otherconstituents of glass ontothePd.TheSIMS measurements showedthat evenin0.1
M LiOD afterseveral weeks Si couldbeeasilydetectedonthePdsurface. The
electrolytes werepreparedfrom oncedistilledNorell (99.5%)or Isotech(99.9%)D O.

1M LiODwas prepared from Li20 (99.9%)Cerac, Inc.ina glovebag. Upondilutingthis
stocksolution,0.1M LiODwas obtained.Time constants didnot permit yet torunblank
experiments with LiOHelectrolytesolution.
Tritium Measurements
Theanalyses ofthesolutionfortritium wereperformedbyWestinghouseElectric
CompanyusingliquidscintillationcountingonaPackard4030 counter.Theliquid
scintillationcocktails wereprepared withOPTI-FLOUR scintillator.Typically,four
consecutive60min.counts wererecordedand averaged.Anotherprecautionagainst any
possiblecomplications causedbycomponents intheelectrolytesolutionwas avacuum
distillationofthesolutionbeforetritium measurements. Whilethis procedureminimized
thepossibilityofinterference effects withsomeconstituents oftheelectrolyteit causes
someloss ofdissolvedT andDT.Forthis reason someexperiments weredonewithout
2
distillationafterneutralizationofthealkalineelectrolyte.Theelectrolyticsolutionfrom
thecells withNi anodes was neutralized,filtered andcentrifugedtoremovesuspended
nickel oxideparticles. Distillation was also usedwithacentrifugedsample whichshowed
highcounts inordertoensurethat solidparticles withintheelectrolyticsolutionwerenot
responsibleforthehighcount rate.
Neutron Radiation Measurements
Theneutrondetectionwas attemptedbyusingtwo BF counters coupledwitha
3
multichannel analyzer.Theauthors arenot satisfiedthat thebackgroundwas adequately
takenintoaccount withthis experimental arrangement andhencetheresults are
consideredinconclusive. Solidstatetrackrecorders mayproveattractiveforthe
measurements inthefuture.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Tritium
FleischmannandPons (1)reported enhancement oftritium concentrationin the
electrolyteas oneevidencefor acoldfusionofdeuterium.Theenhancement factor(see
Eq.4)is, however, close tothedeuterium/tritium separationS ≈ 2, as recently
D,T
determinedbyCorrigan andSchneider (12). Bockris et al.(13)andWolfet al.(14)
reportedrecentlyenhancements of4to7orders ofmagnitudeoverthebackground. In
this workwehavemeasuredtritium concentrations inopenF-P cells, closedcells with
theNi casingandinfour opencells designedforstudyingthetritium enhancement.
Inopencells a changeintritium concentrationwill occurduetothe additionofD O
2
containingT andduetoremoval byelectrolysis. TheisotopicseparationfactorofTtoD
is definedas
S =(n /n )g/(n /n ) (1)
D T D T s
wheren andn arenumbers ofdeuterium andtritium atoms inthegas (g) andthe
D T
solution(s)phases.
It canbeshown (14)that theenhancement oftritium inacell at time(t)obeys the
followingexpression
n (t)/n (o) -S-(S-1)exp(-t/T) (2)
T T
whereTis thetritium build-uptimeconstant.
Thus, at verylongtimes thetritium concentrationinthesolutionduetoisotopic
separationis S times thetritium concentrationintheoriginal solution.
If therecombinationofD andO is carriedout inthecell oroutsidethecell andthe
2 2
D Oreturnedtothecell,thechangeintritium concentrationintheelectrolyte couldbe
2
brought about eitherbyhavingsubstantial tritium inthepalladium orother cell
components orbyanuclearreaction.Thepalladium was strippedofhydrogenandits
isotopes byelectrochemical oxidationfor24hinLiODsolution.This treatment has
removedanytritium that might possiblybepresent inthePdsamples.
In all ourexperiments, inwhichanenhancement ofTwas observed,alongtime
electrolysis oftheorderofseveral weeks was necessarybeforeobservation ofthe
increaseintritium concentration. Intwoopencells withPt anodes excess tritium was
found.These cells alsoweretheonlyones out of fivewhich generated excess heat.
Table1 gives thecell parameters forwhichenhancement oftritium concentrationwas
observed. In fouropen cells, whichweredesigned tostudytritium accumulation and
generation,were essentiallytest tubes 3cm indiameterwithaTefloncell top.Cathodes
were5 cm long,spot weldedtoanickel ribbonas anelectrical contact; 0.25cm thickNi
foil was usedas anode.Duringalongterm electrolysis ablackresidue,most probably
nickel oxide, accumulatedintheelectrolytein onlytwocells. Theelectrolytewas filtered
andcentrifugedtoremovetheseparticles andthen neutralizedbyHCl before
determinationofT.Whenlargetritium counts thesolutionwas distilledandcounted
again. Insomeinstances (cells 1,2)thesolutionwas vacuum distilledandonlythedistillatewas addedtothescintillatingliquidtoavoidpossiblecomplications with
various species inthesolution.
Theresults are givenin Table2.All measurements weredonein fourruns during
several to24h. The averageof4counts is given withthestandarddeviationindicated.
Thedecreaseinthecount rates forthedistilled vs. neutralizedsamples was negligible.
Thesamples weretakeninintervals of15-20days. Accordingto Bockris et al. (13)after
reachingthemaximum level, thetritium content considerablydecreases afterafewdays,
eventuallydownto theseparationfactor. Ifthis is applicabletoourmeasurements, it may
meanthat wehavenot observedthemaximum amount oftritium probablydueto alow
frequencyofsampling. Thecalculationofthetritium concentrationwas doneinthe

Forcells number1and2 forwhichsome excess heat generationwas observed,the
tritium level amountedto766.43and1730dpm ml-1 respectively. *
Let us comparetheexcess heat generatedinthese opencells withtheamount ofT
found. Ifall ofthe energywere comingfrom thetritium generatingreaction,
D+D→ T+ H+4.03 MeV (6)
this wouldproduce4.03 MeV=4.03•106eV•1.6022•10-19J/eV-6.46•10-13J/reaction.
If 1mW ofpoweris producedinacoldfusionreaction,per1cm3 ofPdthe

Therefore, theobserved 766and1730dpm ml-1 canaccount onlyfor~4-10mW. Much
smaller,but still significant,enhancement oftritium was foundinthe gas phasefor cells

were foundbyBockris et al.(13)forlongelectrolysis times. Incertainshort intervals,
e.g.,oneday,however,a higher concentrationin gas phasewas observed.Thefrequency
ofourmeasurements was not sufficient todetect suchshort-livedchanges.
In anexperiment ofthis importanceoneshould address thequestionofthe
contaminationbyTofmaterials usedintheexperiments. Thequestioncan beruledout
onthegrounds that thesamematerials havebeen usedforthecells that gavezerotritium
enhancement andthenecessityforthelongchargingofPdbeforeobservationofT.
Electrochemical oxidationofH,D,orT, annealingand catalyticcombustion,duringthe
pretreatment makeunlikelythepossibilitythat tritium camefrom thepalladium samples
contaminatedbytritium beforetheexperiments.
Coulometric Determination of D absorbed in Pd Cathodes
MetallicPdcanabsorbD toform asolidPdD solution.Forcathodes equilibratedwith
x
airat ambient temperatureandpressure,avalueof x ofabout 0.7to0.8is widely
accepted.The reactivityofDinPdmayvaryconsiderablywithx,particularlyifx
exceeds 0.8,andthereforeacoulometricdeterminationofx was made.The working
electrode was a coil ofPdwire(diameter=0.025 cm,area=1.86cm2,mass =0.12g;
99.997%,Puratronic grade,Johnson Matthey)crimpedtogetherwiththeendofa gold
wire(d=0.05 cm; 99.9985%,Puratronic,Johnson Matthey) whichserved as theleadto
thepotentiostat.Athree compartment electrochemical cell was used.The electrolyte,0.1
M LiODwas continuouslyandvigorouslydegassedwithN (99.995%,Ultrapure,
2
Matheson).The counter electrode, aPdcoil (A= 2cm2),was inachamber connectedto
theworkingchamberbyaglass tubefilledwitha glass wool plug.The reference
electrode was a reversibledeuterium electrode (RDE).
Theworkingelectrodewas rinsedwith0.1 M LiODand D Oelectrolytesolutionand
2
cycledbetween0.25 and 1.35Vuntil thesteadystatevoltammogram showninFig.1
(dashedline) was obtained.Thecell was thenrinsedandrefilledwithfresh electrolyte
solutionandspargedwithN gas. Whenthecell was left at open circuit forseveral days,
2
it cametorest at +0.83 V,andit always returnedto+0.83Vat open circuit whetherit
was offset topositiveor negativepotentials. Whentheworkingelectrode was potentio-
statedat 0.83V,nocurrent flowed.
Figure2shows the chronoamperometrycurves for thechargingofPdwith Dat -0.3V
anddischargingof Dfrom Pdat +0.83V.Duringthechargingat -0.3V,therewas nonoticeableD gas evolutionat theworkingelectrode.This suggests that whenDis
2
formedonthePdsurface at -0.3V,initiallymost oftheDis absorbedinto thebulkPd.
Duringchargingat -0.3 V,themagnitudeofthecurrent was ~10mAinthe first minute,
graduallydroppedto ~1.5mAafter10hours, and finallystabilizedat ~0.7 mAafter1
day.
Thereis aninflectioninthechronocoulometrychargingcurve at ~0.3V(Fig.1,bottom
curve) after10h. It was also noticedthat after10 ormorehours that ifthe N bubbler
2
was liftedoverthe electrolytesolution,D bubbles werevisibleandslowlynucleatingat
2
thePdsurface.Theseobservations suggest that after10hthechargingofthePdwithDis
nearlycompleted. Thelineardiffusionlawis statedas, <x>2 =2Dt,with<x>beingthe
meandistancetraveled in time,t,withdiffusioncoefficient,D. Aneffective diffusion
coefficient ofDthrough Pdforthechargingprocess,D ,canbecalculatedbyusing
charging
t =10hours and<x>=0.0125cm (theradius oftheelectrode), andthevalueforD
charging
is ~2×10-9 cm2s-l.Thetransport ofDintoPdwire is morecomplicatedthanthat
representedbysimplelineardiffusionbecauseduringDloadingthe electrodewouldbe
modeled betteras acylinderwhichis slowlyexpanding.
Theendpoint ofthechargingprocess was difficult toassignsincePdD formationand
x
D evolutioncanoccursimultaneouslyas discussedabove.Thedischargingprocess at
2
+0.83Vwas easilyspotted becausethecurrent goes tozerowhendischargeis complete.
Althoughthechargingof DintoPd(bottom curves inFigs. 1and2)tookover10h,
dischargingofDfrom Pdat +0.83V(seetopcurves inFigs. 1and2)was completed
after~70minutes. Usingthelineardiffusionlaw,this endpoint suggests an effective
diffusioncoefficient for dischargingDfrom Pd, D ,of~2×10-8 cm2s-1.One
discharging
analogous featureinthe discharge chronoamperometrycurve,not noticeableinFig.1,is
asinusoidal rippleinthecurvebetween11/2and 8minutes. This rippleispossiblydue
toasuddenphasetransitioninthecathodefrom theαto β phase as it loses ~40%ofthe
total 106.5C ofchargein this timeinterval.
Several other chargingpotentials weretried,but theoptimal chargingpotential was
~-0.3Vvs. RDE.TherateofchargingPdwithD was impracticallyslowat lower
overpotentials (i.e.,potentials morepositivethan -0.25V).Ontheotherhand,therateof
chargingPdwithDwas not noticeablyincreased at greateroverpotentials (i.e.,more
negativethan -0.3V),althoughthe rateof D2evolutiondidappeartoincreasewith
increasingoverpotential. Figure6shows the chronocoulometrycurveforloadingDinto
Pdat -0.35V(seebottom curve).Comparingthis andtheanalogous curveinFig.7for
loadingat -0.3 V,onecanseethat at anygiventimetherewas moretotal negativecharge
fortheloadingof-0.35 Vversus at -0.3V. Furthermore, eventhoughthe total charge
collectedat -0.35 V(-255 C)was greaterthanthe total charge collected at -0.3V(-142
C),bothexperiments gaveroughlythesametotal valuefordischarge at +0.83V,namely
+107C.Similarly,thetotal chargecollectedat -0.4Vwas -289C (and was accompanied
byevenstrongerD bubbleevolution),but still dischargingthePdcathodeloadedthis
2
waygavejust +122C.
Themass ofthePdinthe electrode was 0.12 gwhichcorresponds to1.1 ×10-3moles
ofPd.Assumingthat the positivecharge collected at +0.83Vis dueonlyto thedischarge
ofDfrom Pd,themoles ofDinPdcanbe calculatedfrom Faraday's law, moles(D)=
Q(discharge)/nF,inwhichnis 1 forthedischarge of1Dfrom Pdand Fis Faraday'sconstant (9.65 ×104C/equivalent).Theresults are summarizedinTable3.All threecases
indicatethat there was oneDabsorbedperPdatom intheelectrodeoverthis rangeof
loadingpotentials with0.1 M LiOD and D Oas theelectrolytesolution.

Theloadinganddischargingprocesses were essentiallyreversiblewhenthe loading
potentials weremorepositivethan -0.4V.Whenlargeroverpotentials, e.g., -0.6Vvs.
RDE,wereusedthevalueofthesubsequent dischargefell to~+90C,i.e.,the
correspondingratioofD toPdinthechargedelectrodewas ~0.8.This suggests that
chargingPdcathodes at highover-potentials (or alternativelyat high constant currents)
mayresult inirreversible damagetotheelectrode, whichmayprevent attaininghigher
ratios ofDtoPd.
GENERAL DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Theresults reportedhere support,toacertain extent,theclaims oftritium generatedin
theelectrolysis ofD OonPdofdeuterium reportedbyFleischmann,Pons andHawkins
2
(1).Thefollowingconclusions havebeen reached:
1. Enhancement oftritium was foundintwoout offiveopencells withPt-anodes and
fourout offour cells withNi-anodes. Thelargest enhancement factorwith respect to
D Ois ~50.Theheat level is bythreeorders ofmagnitudelargerthantheheat
2
correspondingtotheobservedtritium levels.
2. Theratioofdeuterium topalladium atoms was foundtobe1for0.25 mm wire,
charged at E=-0.3 -0.65 V.
3. Theneutronradiationmeasurements wereinconclusiveduetotheuncertaintyin
determiningthebackgroundcorrection.
In general,ontheexperimental sidethere are,however,manyquestions tobeanswered
inordertoincreasetheunderstandingofthis phenomenon.Theseincludethe
irreproducibilityand sporadicityofthephenomenon,necessityfor aprolonged
electrolysis beforetheexcess heat ortritium productionoccur,the roleofthe
microstructure andofthe traceimpurities inpalladium,thedifferencebetweenthe
amount ofexcess heat in openandclosed cell,the roleofsurfaceimpurities andtherole
oflithium,ifany.
Onthetheoretical sidethequestions appeareven moredifficult.Table4lists possible
fusionreactionofdeuterium.Accordingtotheacceptedtheories the evidencefor fusion
ofdeuterium requires, besides theheat generation, acorrespondingamount ofneutrons,
tritium and 3He.Thebranchingratioofreaction AandB (Table3)is approximatelyone.
Thecross sectionforreactionC is ontheorderof 107 lowerthanforAand B(1). γ-rays
shouldbeobservedifthe reaction C occurs inthe electrochemical cell.
Nodataonelectrochemicallyinducedfusionsatisfies indisputablyanyofthese
requirements. Inorderto overcomethesedifficulties several newmechanisms offusion
havebeen proposed.Theseincludethemechanisms inwhichtheenergyfrom thereaction
C dissipates intothelatticeas heat ratherthan γ-photon(17,18),orinwhichtwo
deuterons as bosons aresqueezedtogetherinasphereof anoctahedral site(19).
Dendrites onPdsurface havebeensuggestedas anexplanationfortritiumgeneration,
duetoincreasedelectric fields aroundthedendritetips (13).Fracto-fusionwas alsomentionedas apossibleexplanationin analogywiththeexplanationofneutron
generationupon fracturingLiDsinglecrystals (19).Thereis, obviously, aneedformore
workinorderto estimatethemerits oftheseexplanations, as well as reach acomplete
understandingofthe FleischmannandPons phenomenon.

1. Introduction
Our work consists of two parts. In the first stage, we carried out investigations of
theinfluenceofthedeformationoftitaniumalloysamplessaturatedwithdeuterium
1
on the occurrence of cold nuclear fusion. The basic results of these investigations
were obtained in the years 1990–1992.
In the beginning of this work, we started with the assumption that the struc-
ture of metals influences the processes proceeding in a solid phase. Obviously, the
intrinsic properties of ametallic matrixare responsible not onlyfor the abilityof a
material to accumulate deuterons but also for the possibility of deuterons to move
and interact. That is why the processes occurring during the cold fusion should be
sensitive to the structure of the metals and alloys used.
As is known,plastic deformation changes the character of the distribution, and
increases the density, of crystal lattice defects – dislocations, vacancies, stacking
2 3
faults,andlowandhighanglegrainboundaries. It isalsowellknown that hydro-
gen isotopes, being interstitial atoms, interact with crystal lattice defects creating
atmospheres of impurity atoms. One can expect that during plastic deformation
the migration of these defects should influence the rate of the processes occurring
during the fusion of deuteron nucleus.
2. Neutron measurements
In the initialstage ofourinvestigations,we detected neutrons usinga fieldmonitor
(RUP-1)withafast-neutroncounter. Theradiationdetected inthiscasecorrelated
in time with processes occurring during the saturation by deuterium, or during
the deformation of deuterium saturated samples. The titanium alloy VT9 (6.5Al–
3.3Mo–1.5Zr–0.25Si) was used for the investigations. For these studies, we use
cylindricalsampleswithdimensions 10× 15mm,thatwere saturated bydeuterium

from a gas phase up to concentration 2–20 at.%. Deformation of the samples was
carried out by compression uusing the scheme showed in Figure 1.
Thetemperature ofdeformationwasselected onthe basisofdifferentialthermal
analysis (DTA) data (Fig. 2). At the temperature T ≈ 650◦ C, the weight of a
sample starts to reduce, and a bend is observed on the DTA curve that testifies
an intense escape of deuterium from a sample in the argon atmosphere. In the
process of deformation of titanium alloy samples (at a temperature T = 710◦ C),
preliminarily saturated by deuterium, radiation, which is not a neutron flux, was
detected. Figure 3 shows the time dependence of the load during deformation of
the samples. Figure 4presents the (x-y) coordinate record ofthe emissiondetected
by the field-effect monitor RUP-1. The break of deformation, or the increase in
the strain rate by 10 times and more, resulted in a disappearance of the emission.
In Fig. 3, the letters A and B indicate the time moments at which the traverse
movement was stopped, and the same symbols indicate the periods of the absence
of deformation in Fig. 4.

Twobatches ofVT9alloysampleswere studied. Thefirstbatchofsampleshave
a structure with the size of primary β grains 500±100µm, α plate thickness of
6±1µm, and the amount of β phase about 20%. Deuterium saturation of these
samples did not lead to any significant changes in the structure, except for the
growth of the amount of β phase up to 50%. The microstructure of the second
batch of samples was characterized by the absence of α plates at matrix β grain

and radiation was registered from two of them. The concentration of deuterium in
these samples was C D = 11–12at.%, while in the third sample it was considerably
lower–C D =8at.%. Thesamplesofthesecondbatchpossessedmorefinestructure,
and the radiation in these samples was detected only after their structure became
similar to that of the first batch samples.
3. Tritium measurements
To confirm the occurrence of cold nuclear fusion, the measurement of tritium con-
centration wasperformed bythe scintillationmethodvialayerwisegrinding. It was
found that in all samples in which emission was detected during deformation, the
concentrationoftritiuminthesurfacelayerwasincreasedby3–7timesascompared
1
to the background value. The energy spectrum of these samples corresponded to
tritium.
We did not publish the results of this work in 1992 because the field monitor
RUP-1 with a fast-neutron counter is not a reliable device to be used for scientific
purposes. We have procured the radiometric device SRPS-2 having fast-neutron
3
counters with a lamp SI-18H filled by He. Using this new device, we deformed
about 50 samples but no appreciable neutron fluxes were registered.
After that, we conducted a joint experiment with a group of scientists from
Ekaterinburg, on neutron detection in the process of saturation of our samples by
deuterium. Whereas MKS-01 (a device similarto RUP-1) registered neutrons, the
device SRPS-2 (the sensitivity of which is 100 times higher than that of MKS-01)
did not register. Having performed this experiment we assumed that we registered
electromagnetic radiation with a spectrum in the radio frequency regime. The
tritium concentration was increased by 50% as compared to the background level
evenly throughout the volume of this sample. The uniform distribution of tritium
withinthe sampleinteriorafter itssaturationbydeuterium does notcontradict the
previous conclusion aboutthe nonuniformityofthe distribution,since a sufficiently
high temperature applied during the present experiment leads to a convection-
diffusion leveling of the deuterium concentration.
4. RF measurements
In the second stage, we attempted the measurement of the (RF) radiation that we
assumed was present during experiments in the first stage. In these experiments
we attempted to measure radio-frequency radiationonly during saturation of sam-
ples by deuterium, using various detection systems. Neutron detection with the
radiometric device SRPS-2 was conducted during all our subsequent experiments.
Electromagneticemissionintherangeofradiofrequencieswasdetected byusing
different measuring devices:357
(1) A magnetic antenna with one turn in a symmetric copper ring with a notch. A
signal fromthe antenna was transmitted toa wide-band amplifier UZ-29, then to
an amplifier with a gain factor of K =104 (10 in a fourth degree), and after that
to a ratemeter.
(2) A field meter M20 of optoelectronics (USA) with a telescopic antenna, 10cm in
length.
(3) Anelectronschemecomprisinganantenna,10cminlength,apulseamplifierwith
againfactorofK=5×103
(fiveincreasedon10inthethirddegree),discriminator
and former drawing in a short signal forits recording.
For visualizationof the emission detected in all cases, the signal is transmitted
to an x-y coordinate plotter.
Electromagnetic emission in the range of radio frequencies was detected during
the saturation of titanium alloy VT-9 samples by deuterium from the gas phase
at the temperature T = 860± 10◦ C. Prior to the saturation the samples were
subjected toabend strainatthe roomtemperature inathree-point modeuntilthe
onset of plastic deformation.
RF emission has been detected under the conditions of continuously increasing
pressure of deuterium. The rate of deuterium pressure increase was
dp
≈0.8kPa/s.
dt
The signal appeared at a pressure of p ≈ 24kPa and continued for 2–3min. RF
emission was detected by means of each scheme described above. However, while
in the case of the third scheme, the plotter recorded separate temporal resolution
signals analogousto the field monitors RUP-1 and MKS-01;in case of the first two
schemes a wide enveloping maximumwas recorded due to the inertia of measuring
systems. The RF emission had a sporadic character; the same character was noted
when detecting the neutron flows in the first years of cold nuclear fusion study.
5. Probable mechanism
The generationof tritiumwhile neutron flows are absent suggests that coldnuclear
4
fusion occurs through a tritium channel as has been assumed earlier. The nonuni-
formformationoftritiumwithinthesampleinteriorafterdeformationtestifies that
the process of cold nuclear fusion occurs only in a surface layer. The same conclu-
5
sion was also made in the review of early papers. The presence of electromagnetic
radiation also confirms this conclusion, since the radio waves can be radiated only
from near surface layers of metallic materials.
RF emission was detected only during the saturation of titanium alloysamples
by deuterium, while during the saturation by conventional hydrogen it was not
detected. We presume that the appearance of tritium in the samples where RF
emission was detected points to the occurrence of cold nuclear fusion.358
Wesuggestthatthemostprobablemechanismoftheoccurrence ofRFemission,
which accompanies cold nuclear fusion, is the interaction of products of nuclear
reaction
2 D + 2 D → 1 p+ + 3 T+ + E(4.03Mev),
tritiumandproton,withthemetallicmatrix. Themovementofchargedparticlesin
the periodic field of the crystal lattice can result in the occurrence of RF emission.
Unfortunately, we did notfind articles about measurements of radiationwithinthe
range ofradiofrequencies when charged particles pass throughthe metallicmatrix.
The registration of such radiation can become indirect proof of the cold nuclear
fusion occurrence along the tritium channel.
6. Discussion
Some authors account for the presence oftritiumby the fact that its smallamount
ispresent indeuteriumorinthemetalunderstudy. Thepreliminarypreparationof
samples in our experiments excluded the presence of tritiuminthe metalbefore its
saturation by deuterium. Duringpreliminaryvacuumannealingupto T =1200◦ C
for 1h, the sample is completely clean from all hydrogen isotopes.
During the second stage of our work, we were not engaged in measurements of
tritium. Now, we are trying to carry out new experiments to produce a significant
amount of tritium. Only after successful termination of this experiment will we
plan to start the measurement of heat effects.
The assumptions that have been presented in this work are not of a revolution-
ary nature. For their confirmation it is no need to create new physics. Simply
this physics differs from the physics of hot nuclear fusion. In the former case, the
processes occur in plasma. Cold nuclear fusion occurs in hard metal, under tem-
◦
peratures below 1000 C.
7. CONCLUSIONS
(1) Duringsuccessivethree-stepcompressionofpreliminarilydeuteriumsaturatedVT-
9 alloy samples, an emission has been detected in the third stage of deformation,
whichis not a flow of neutrons or gamma quanta.
(2) In the surface layer of the samples for which the emission was detected, the con-
centration of tritiumexceeded the background level by 3–7 times.
(3) The occurrence of emission and excess tritium concentration are associated with
aspecific structure of thesamples, and observed only inthe coarse-grained gross-
lamellarstructure.
(4) During the saturation of VT-9 alloy samples by deuterium, an electromagnetic
emission has been detected in the range of radio frequencies. Evidently, it was
a pulse emission in the range of radio frequencies that was detected as neutrons
during cold nuclear fusion by neutron monitors inearly works.359

INTRODUCTION
In any field of investigations new ideas in combination with newly developed equipment
can provide advance results. In view of arising interest to cold nuclear fusion (CNF) [1] and
searches for consequences of its occurrence the study of the interaction of hydrogen with
metals has coincided with the wide spread of the micro-probe X-ray spectrum analysis. This
analysis is performed during measurements of alloying element concentration [1] with
resolution of about 1x1 µm2.
Savvotimova et al. [2] revealed the appearance of residual elements on the surface of a
palladium cathode after electrolysis in the plasma of а glow discharge in deuterium medium
and established that concentration of these elements increases by tens and thousands times.
The authors ascribe the local concentration of elements (Ag, B, Ni, et al.) to transmutation
resulted from nuclear reactions, though, according to the measurements made by the authors,
the number of detected γ -quanta is 8-10 times less than it is required for the case of
appearance of such amount of residual elements. The results of this paper in respect to
accumulation of elements are confirmed in a number of publications relating to electrolysis
on palladium cathodes [3,4] where the term “non-expected elements “ was introduced.
The present paper ascribes the appearance of these clusters in titanium alloy samples to
ascending diffusion of impurities.
MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
A sample of VT9 titanium alloy was saturated by hydrogen (1H) from a gas phase at the
temperature T= 8500 C up to the concentration C = 0, 57 wt. % using a Siverts type device.
H
The sample was subjected to multiple steps forging in the air at the temperature T≈ 6000 C
with changing the axis of deformation through 900 according to the technique described in
[5].
The analysis of its composition was made using an electron microscope Jeol JXA-6400
with an X-ray-fluorescent adapter.
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In recent years we studied the formation of ultra fine-grained structure in titanium alloys
during severe plastic deformation using reversible hydrogen alloying [5]. Prior to mechanical
testing the samples was subjected to degassing. The samples with a total weight of 30 g and a
minimum thickness of 2mm were installed into a special device. In the process of
dehydrogenation annealing of the samples at the temperature 600°C one observed a semi-
transparent film of a metal with the dimensions ∅35x120 mm at the distance of 100 mm from
the furnace. The metal observed was Zn, and its concentration was no less than 98 %. Thespectrum analysis of the initial metal showed the presence of Zn with the concentration not
exceeding 10-4 wt %. The rapid calculation showed that the available amount of Zn was
sufficient for the formation of the film revealed.
DISCUSSION OF RESULTS
First of all it should be noted that the alloy was saturated by conventional hydrogen (1H),
and one cannot speak about any transmutation of elements.
One of the most advanced theories of solid-state physics is a notion of dislocations as
microscopic defects of a crystal lattice. At present, on the basis of the theory of dislocations
many experimental facts are explained including those connected with the interaction of
hydrogen with metals. It is known that hydrogen interaction with dislocations creates
atmospheres [6-8].
A number of studies devoted to the formation of dislocations and their interaction with
interstitial and substitutional impurities during deformation of metals are known. For
example, it was concluded [9] that substitution atoms with an ion radius larger than the ion
radius of the basic metal (R ) and all interstitial atoms are concentrated in the region of
0
tension formed by the dislocation field, while atoms with the ion radius smaller than R tend
0
to the region of compression.
It is also known that hydrogen atmospheres move at rather low strain rates since with
increasing strain rates to some critical values, dislocations lose contact with atmospheres [6].
That is why traditionally low strain rates are used for the formation of fine-grained structure
[10]. The joint action of these processes is responsible for the formation of segregations of
residual elements with hydrogen in the vicinity of the sample surface during multiple step
forging. Further vacuum annealing of samples at the temperature T≈ 6000 C leads to intense
release of hydrogen that leaves the sample together with zinc impurity.
The elevated rate of diffusion in the presence of dislocation was noted in a number of
studies devoted to self-diffusion [11, 12], and was explained as diffusion along dislocation
tubes [13]. So, the extraction of zinc from samples can be explained by well known
mechanisms of solid-state physics without applying additional ideas such as transmutation of
elements.
The process of saturation of samples by hydrogen isotopes at room temperature also leads
to the processes analogous to the ones described above. However, this occurs not due to
external deformation. As the hydrogen concentration in the metallic matrix increases the
constant lattice grows [7, 8] and at room temperature this results in initiation and growth of
internal stresses. These stresses generate dislocations that have their own non-symmetric
stress fields. The region of tension created by these stresses is inhabited by interstitial and
substitutional atoms the sizes of which are larger than the sizes of atoms of the basic metal,
while the region of compression is inherited by substitutional atoms with sizes less than those
of the basic metal. As a result, Kottrel atmospheres are created [9].
It is rather easy to explain the formation of hydrogen atmospheres and segregation of
metal ions in them during electrolysis in water solutions or saturation in the plasma of а glow
discharge, the radius of metal ions being different from that of the titanium or palladium.
Nobody doubts in the existence of atmospheres of hydrogen atoms at room temperature. That
is why the creation of clusters of residual elements depends only on the duration time of
hydrogen saturation that should be long because of the low rate of diffusion. Then, due to the
movement of such clusters some impurity elements come to the surface.
From photos given in [3, 4] it is seen that segregations of unexpected elements have a
local character. On the basis of general considerations it seems that exactly so must look the
results of local diffusion along the dislocation tubes.The influence of such atmospheres comprising deuterium and concentrated impurities on
fusion of deuterium nuclei, i.e. cold nuclear fusion itself, is not yet clear. This issue requires
additional studies.
The occurrence of such high concentrations of alloying elements in the vicinity of the
surface of a metal can lead to the formation of new phases including the ordered ones. Due to
their brittleness these phases can cause initiation of cracks and this might be one more reason
for hydrogen brittleness.
Besides, this phenomenon has its own independent value, since after more thorough study
it can be used for purification of hydrogen solvent metals from impurities. This can be
implemented for processing articles out of pure and extremely pure metals such as palladium
and titanium.

• On the basis of the results of our previous
experiments on deformation of deuterium
saturated titanium alloy samples and
saturation of titanium alloys, the mechanism
of cold nuclear fusion proceeding via the
tritium channel is proposed.Background
• While planning our experiment we proceeded
from the following :
• 1. cold nucleus fusion should be uninterrupted,
• 2. experiment should be performed at high
temperature to increase a rate of deuterium
diffusion in metal,
• 3. deuterium flow should be orientated in one
direction.Background
• The performance of the experiment in
deuterium gas phase provides all these
conditions. Since the process occurs on the
metal surface the reaction displays more
evidently at diffusion of deuterium through
a membrane. Glow discharge on one side of
the membrane creates orientated deuterium
flow.Scheme of a device

The key to Understanding Energy in
Nanotechnology & NatureNature assembles ordered
structures out of chaos without a
temperature gradient or energy
input.
Systems generally go from ordered to
chaotic.
How does nature go from the chaotic to
ordered?Atoms in most solids vibrate at high
frequency and low amplitude
Atoms’ nuclei generally reside in parabolic potential
wells.
The nuclei undergo simple harmonic motion as if
they were connected by springs.Some Materials have non-parabolic
potential wells
They produce nonlinear vibrational
modes

• Ferromagnetism is a cooperative phenomenon
• Ferrites processed at 3 – 12nm have cooperative

Abstract
A relatively simple technique using CR39 particle
detectors has been developed that in 25 consecutive
electrolyses has reproducibly produced charged
particle tracks, showing unambiguous evidence of a
nuclear reaction during electrolysis of heavy or light
water solutions. Nuclear tracks can be produced upon
the surface and beyond the 1 mm thickness of the
CR39 detectors. Nuclear activity of some sort can
persist in the Viton o-rings used in the electrolysis cell
so that charged energetic particles can be generated
subsequently without electrolysis.

Via Tolomeo,1 – 20010 Cornaredo (MI)Oriani’s results
Examination showed that haze patterns following the
circumference of the o-rings had developed, similar to
that illustrated by Fig.5. However, the central regions
of the areas bounded by the haze rings were clear.
The track densities were 55 tracks/cm2 on one chip
and 70 on the other. These numbers are to be
compared with the background value of 55 per cm2
and with over 2000 tracks /cm2 found in the center of
the chip pictured in Fig.5.

Mylar interposed between Pd cathode and

contaminated by electrolytic solution during
D loading
Artifacts on CR 39 plate can produce wrong

Experiments with mylar between
electrolyte and CR39 give a pit density
of same magnitude compared with
blank (no current) test; in one case
less.
Pits appearance in test without mylar
is strictly different from nuclear tracks
visible on the same chip
Under the Pd cathode mark there is
not an increase of pit density respect
to the neighbor

41,41,,,,http://lenr-canr.org/acrobat/ViolanteVproceeding.pdf#page=109,"This study was initiated due to the concern of some critics of LENR research that small energy changes in many H2O or D2O molecules in electrochemical cells can explain observed excess heat. More than three hundred LENR papers from 1989 to 2008 that reported excess energy were acquired and reviewed to extract quantitative results and other information. Excess energies and cell volumes were found in 17 papers. These data were used to compute eV per water molecule values. Most experiments showed excess energy outputs that would lead to ratios below the vibrational energy of water molecules at room temperature (0.04 eV/molecule). However, 65% of the papers, which reported both excess energies and cell volumes, indicated values significantly higher. The highest  reported value was 42.6 eV/molecule. Eleven ratios are far beyond what is plausible for water to be the source of anomalous heat. Therefore, it is concluded that some unknown rearrangement of water molecules in many LENR experiments is not the source of excess heat.","Al Katrib, A. K.; Nagel, D.

Vittorio Violante RdA, Francesca SartoPreface
We had the great honor to organize ICCF15 in Rome, occurring on the 20th anniversary of the announcement
of Professor Martin Fleischman, our Honorary Chairman, and Prof. Stanley Pons in the spring of 1989.The
20th Anniversary is certainly giving a specific meaning to the Symposium supported by the content of the
given lectures.
We had the honor and the privilege that the Conference, supported by the Italian Agency for Energy New
Technologies and Sustainable Development (ENEA), was under the patronage of the Italian Physical
Society (SIF), of the Italian Chemical Society (SCI) and of the Italian National Research Council (CNR).
We also had the honor to have as speakers Prof. Martin Flaischmann, Dr. Renzo Tomellini (Genaral
Directorate for Research of the European Commission), Prof Luigi Campanella (President of the Italian
Chemical Society), Dr. Enzo De Sanctis (Vice-President of the Italian Chemical Society) and Prof. Robert
Duncan (Research Chancellor of the Missouri University).
During the last two decades we understood that condensed matter nuclear science is an extraordinary mixing
of knowledge because of the wide interdisciplinary character of such a research field and our opinion is that
this aspect has characterized this event.
The letter we received from the President of the Italian National Council of Research –CNR- Prof. Luciano
Maiani perfectly describes our feeling:
He said: “The high scientific value of the event on condensed matter nuclear science represents a reason of
great interest for the research world involved into the many aspects of such a discipline”.
We received also appreciations and wishes for the very interesting Conference, by the Department Committee
of the Mechanical Engineering Faculty of the University of Tor Vergata in Rome.
During the Conference Prof. Martin Fleischmann was awarded with the Preparata golden medal into the
wonderful scenario of Castel Sant’Angelo.
The ICCF15 participants have been received by S.S. the Pope Benedetto XVI into the Vatican.
In order to draw the conclusions about the outcome of our contribution to the Conference we all need to
consider the objectives and compare them with the results.
On the occasion of the anniversary of Fleischmann and Pons announcement we were due to guarantee the
best success to this Conference.
The participation of prestigious Institutions, the content and the level achieved by the lectures and the
increased interest concerning our discipline have been the indicators for the level of the conference as well
as of the scientific importance of the matter.
The Symposium has created the appropriate conditions for a useful exchange of ideas and for an
advantageous osmosis of knowledge among disciplines concerning the condensed matter nuclear science.
The material science, the enhanced screening in nuclear processes, nanoscience, interphase phenomena and
other disciplines are emerging as fundamental pillars in our research field.
Now considering the question whether the F&P effect exists or not the answer is given by the results
presented at the conference and on previous occasions.
Considering the question whether the full control and understanding of the effect have been achieved the
ianswer is given by the hard work done up to now and the harder and harder work still to be done in the
future.
We personally consider that the scientific out coming of this conference be the beginning of a new scientific
age for our studies
A big research work has been done during the last two decades but there is still a huge effort to be carried
out in the years to come and only the involvement of the whole scientific community will make this effort
possible.
Our challenge is to give priority to an easy and smooth interaction with the whole scientific community
optimizing the effort mentioned above.
We have already done this in the past thanks to the programs reviewing the matter, we have continued
during ICCF-15 and we will do the same in the years to come. This is our future!
First of all we wish to thank the Institutions giving their Patronage to the Conference: The Italian Physical
Society, The Italian Chemical Society and the CNR.
We thank also ENEA for supporting the Event.
Thanks are due to Enenergetics Technologies since they partially sponsored the Conference and in particular
the CEO Ms. Alison Godfrey.
We have also to thank Dr. G.Dattoli, and Dr. G. Hubler since they guided in a masterly manner the round
table on theories.
We acknowledge the chairs of the conference sessions, for their skills and professionalism in heading the
discussion.
We are very grateful to the co-chair Dr. S. Lesin, to the chair and to the co-chair of the Scientific Committee
Prof. Franco Scaramuzzi and Dr. F. Frisone.
Very well deserved thanks to the president of the Kyoto Club Dr. G. Silvestrini for his lecture and to Prof.
Melich and Prof. D. Nagel for their help in starting the job .
Thanks are also due to ISCMNS for supporting the Preparata Golden Medal Award.
We wish also to thank Dr. M. Polidoro, she was the Architect of the Conference, and the ENEA Staff: M.
Cecchini, C. Torelli, F. Simoni, Emanuele Castagna, Stefano Lecci, Mirko Sansovini, D. Karacostas, L.
Crescentini ed E.Vitale because of for their valuable effort in supporting the Event. A particular thank is for
the Scientific Secretary of the Conference Francesca Sarto since her professional skill and accuracy was
fundamental for the success of the Symposium.
Note about the Proceedings publication
This Book of Proceedings collects most of the papers presented at the 15th International Conference on
Condensed Matter Nuclear Science (ICCF-15), held in Rome on 5-9 October 2009.
All the presenting authors have been invited to submit their paper for publication in the Proceedings and
about the 90% of them accepted the invitation.
The papers have been reviewed by referees chosen from the scientific community, both inside and outside
the more restricted group of scientists working in the field of “cold fusion”.
Due to skepticism of some part of the scientific community and lack of an established literature on this topic
in full accredited journals, the review process was not intended to filter papers but to stimulate critical
revision of his own work by each author. The aim was to get papers which could be as much as possible
understandable by the open scientific community, discussing in deep the possible sources of artifacts and
errors in the experimental results and clearly highlighting the working hypothesis, approximations and limits
of the theoretical models.

2. Discussion
Those expecting me to answer the charge implied in the title of this talk will be disappointed – perhaps doubly so
– although I suggest you stay to the end. I do not have a clear answer for myself, let alone for the community –
the technical equivalent of a “killer app” if you will – that, once accomplished (hopefully promptly), will convince

Ofcrucialandpertinentrelevancetomyinabilitytoanswerthechargeinthepapertitle,ifIhad“thesecret”,and
presuming for a moment that any one person could conceive or carry such a secret to term, I would very likely be

Possibly a worse problem than the formal and codified secrecy of information held to be “IP” is the discourage-
mentofresearchpursuit,analysisandpublication. Myfirstandlargestsponsorof“coldfusion”researchatSRIwas
EPRI – the Electric Power Research Institute located in Palo Alto, California. I have a long-standing, fruitful and
joyousresearchpartnershipwithEPRIextendingbackto1978–initiallyofthetopicofthepalladium-hydrogenand
palladium-deuterium systems for purposes other than “cold fusion” [2]. All these works were “semi-public” in the
sense that reports were prepared and made publicly available (occasionally behind a pay wall) and open publication
waspermitted, ifnotencouraged. EPRIsponsoredourexperimentsthatresultedinthefirstfivecontributionstomy

experiments. Theevidenceofthisissufficientlystrong,well-publishedandreplicatedalreadytocallintoquestionat

and marginalized. So much so that none but the most courageous dare pursue Martin Fleischmann’s undertaking to

An important part of the very effective ostracism of CMNS results and research is prevention of publication in
mainstream journals. Most recently this has occurred behind an editorial modesty screen of “we do not think our

ColdFusionbeganitsmodernpublicincarnationonMarch23,1989,sixdaysbeforeMartinFleischmann’s62nd
birthday. Stan Pons was 45 ... I was 40. I would argue that Physical Scientists do their best work from their late
30’s through their early 60’s (Physicists earlier, Mathematician even more so). Stan and Martin were well in this
groove–Martinonthe“leadingedge”. IwasayoungsterinwhatInowrecognizereflectivelyasmymosteffective
and productive scientific years. After graduating my PhD trained by one of John Bockris’ first PhD students (John
Tomlinson), I had taken advantage of two years of postdoctoral study at the University of Southampton in England.

the publication embargo). The young and the old have courage to look in new places but scientists of the age and
position I was in in 1989 presently are heavily discouraged from entering CMNS. In a world of contract research
where reputation is everything anyone except the most courageous seeking to build a research team simply cannot
afford to swim against the mainstream – just the denial of publications and patents ensures this. I claim we cannot
succeedbydiligenceandhopealonewithoutthiscoregroupofmid-careerscientists,andmanysuchgroupsworking

How do we engage the critical group of researchers, giving them confidence that there is a “there there”, that it

forthedevelopmentandpromulgationofaprocedurefora“referenceexperiment”thatreliablyembodiestheelements
of “new cold fusion” that produces unambiguous and obvious evidence, and is easily performed by anyone (or any
laboratory) with “normal skill in the art”. I argued against the wisdom of this at ICCF-14 in 2008 on the grounds
of public safety but also made the point [8]: “If the claim is made that replication is crucial to the development of
ourfieldtodeterminetheparametersforadvancement,toproverealitytocritics,ortouncoversystematicerror,then
it is astonishing that attempts to replicate the FPE have been so few, and methodologically so limited ...it must be

we simply set out to test the hypothesis that: “there is an unexpected and unexplained source of heat in the D/Pd
System that may be observed when Deuterium is loaded electrochemically into the Palladium Lattice, to a sufficient
degree.” This hypothesis was tested positively with funding support from EPRI, and several other conditions were

Ironically it was John Huizenga himself, cold fusion bête noire and co-chair of the ERAB-1 panel, who most
succinctly identified the greatest barrier to early progress, although he used his wisdom to make the wrong point.

were politically outmaneuvered. None of these effects then or now appeared or appear necessarily to be relevant to
condensed matter and coherent nuclear reaction. The prince of this field, Julian Schwinger, was at least willing to

A selection of samples were also characterized by means of inelastic neutron scattering (INS) to study the hydrogen-related features of the acid modification of the carbon supports.

In fact, most of the experiments and deductions of material sciences are based on the assumption that space?time is flat and isotropic (Minkowskian). After discarding this assumption, a theory of Deformed Space Time (DST) was developed in the last decades. Following this theory, experimental results were obtained which are not predicted by the Standard Model. The DST-theory concerns the fundamental interactions and in particular the nuclear ones, that can play the main role in the observed anomalies. In order to consider a nuclear reaction as a DST-reaction, four main phenomenological features were deduced: occurrence of an energy threshold; change of atomic weight; absence of gamma radiation; anisotropic emission of nuclear particles in intense beams having a very short life span. From the experimental point of view, rather than looking for fortuitous events that produce the conditions for DST-reactions, more systematic research can be undertaken by following the above reported four general rules. In particular, the occurrence of thresholds can correspond to a latency time, required to reach the energy density necessary to deform space?time. The absence of gamma radiation cannot be considered as a sign that nuclear reactions are not present; in fact, in absence of detected gamma radiation, elements were found which were not present before the reaction. The nuclear emissions, which are anisotropic and impulsive, can be difficult to detect with the traditional methods, thus inducing incertitude on the occurring reactions. Finally, a rapid variation of energy density is an experimental common factor of DST-reactions. Thus, the DST-theory can be the leading theory in the design of the experiment and in the interpretation of its experimental results.","Albertini, G.; Rogante, M.",BiberianJPjcondensedzc.pdf,Beyond Hydrogen Loading,J.

Introduction
Theproblem about the electroneffectivemass insolids is important withregard toboth
electronandoptical properties ofsolids. Theusual methods ofdetermining theelectron effective
masses are connectedwithpreliminarycalculations ofcorrespondingelectronbandstructures
andfurther computations ofelectronmass values. Theseapproaches assumethere areno external
radiations (laser, etc.)that interact withtheelectrons insolids leadingtoelectronmass
renormalizations accordingtoadeterminedrule[1,2].Generallyit canbe consideredthat all
effectivemass calculations about thecharges (electrons andholes)insolids arebasedonthe
correspondingelectronbandstructures ignoringtherule givenin[1,2].However, recentlysome
authors [3,4] haveconsideredtheimpact ofinteractionofexternal electro-magneticfieldwith
electrons insolids ontheelectroneffectivemass,andtheyhavefoundthat increaseofthis mass
canbe expected.Althoughtheauthors of[3] incomparison withtheauthors of[4] givedifferent

layers ontheelectrodesurface.
Theauthor’s researchprogress [5-8] indeterminingthe electronbandstructures ofdisordered

Discussion about possible interactions of protons with heavy electrons
It canbeseeninTable1 that theeffectivemass of theheavyelectrons canreachhighvalues in
somematerials. However it depends onthelocal field.Thereforethenecessaryandsufficient
conditionthat theheavyelectrons tobehaveas heavynegativeparticles in interactions withother
chargedparticles is that thefieldofeveryinteraction must beweak.
Inthelight ofthe aboveifthis conditionis fulfilled,aheavyelectron e -canparticipatein
h
process [3,11]:
e -+p+→ n+ν (12)
h l
Wherep+,nandν designateproton,neutron and neutrinorespectively. In orderforthis process
l
to takeplacethe followingthreshold conditionabout theeffectivemass ofheavyelectron e -
h
must befulfilled[3]:
β = m / m >2.531 (13)
eff 0
6Theeffectivemasses from Table1even forstrongfieldinteractions (except for In Al N) fulfill
x 1-x
thecondition(13).
It must benotedthat certainparticles must reachtheregionwheretheheavyelectronis
localized fortheinteractiontooccur; i.e.,theprobabilityoftheinteraction ofheavyelectron–
particleis higherinnano-layers orinnano-structureclusters that are closetothesurface.
Conclusion
This papercanbeconsidered the author’s first contributioninthefieldofinteractionof
chargedparticles withelectrons localizedinsolids. Althoughtheexistence ofheavyelectrons in
nano-structures is showntheoreticallytheauthor considers that theconditions about weak
interactioninsolids mustbefoundinorderfurther studyofheavyelectron-particleinteractions
tobeperformed.Findingoftheseconditions will besubject ofa futurework. Future workwill
also considertheroleof heavyelectrons inmetallichydridenano-layers.
