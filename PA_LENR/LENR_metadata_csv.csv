This excitation increases their energy and allows them to cross the bandgap of the semiconductor and pass into the conduction band, as in a photovoltaic cell. This energy very quickly appears as a spontaneous potential difference which can reach over 0.5 volt per junction.The potential drop concentrates on the junction region, and at a nano scale the electric field reaches considerable values, higher than the megavolt per meter, which constrains the deuterium nuclei and increases the probability of deuterium fusion.","David, F.; Giles, J.",DavidFselfpolari.pdf,Self-Polarisation of Fusion Diodes: From Excess Energy to Energy,ICCF-14 International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science,"2,008",,2008-12-16,Excess heat,,,,,,,,,,,

A second mechanism is then described to turn this H2 into a metallic-molecular state, form a Rydberg matter H(1) and then H(0) with a pressure decrease. In NC, the presence of impurities and the entry of the hydrogen atoms in the form of Rydberg atoms are proposed to decrease the pressure required to form metallic-molecular hydrogen.

Nevertheless, fruitful activity has been performed following two main lines. The first line attains to the effort for reaching high values of D/Pd ratio in Pd in order to obtain the best conditions for cold fusion phenomena, in particular power excess production in electrolytic cells. The outcome of this research is the definition of the starting characteristic of Pd (metallurgy), and the procedure for its loading with Deuterium. The calorimetry by now assessed at ENEA Frascati has been used for the detection of power excess. The second line concerns the attempt to detect in a clear way the production of 4He during the power excess episodes.

For all the temperatures in the 150-350 K range and for all the energies between 150 and 250 eV, the formation of microcracks increases the probability of fusion compared to non-deformed lattices, and also reduces the thickness of the Coulomb barrier. Using the trend of the curve of potential to evaluate the influence of the concentration of impurities, a very high barrier is found within the pure lattice (J ? 0.25%). However, under the same thermodynamic conditions, the probability of fusion in the impure metal (J ? 0.75%) could be higher, with a total energy less than the potential so that the tunneling effect is amplified.

In this work we seek to analyse the deuteron-deuteron reactions within palladium lattice by means of Preparata?s model of the palladium lattice [5,15].

Further, in this paper, we have taken the interaction between deuteron-optical photons, we want to clarify this point, of course, these photons have a vibrational frequency of interest because it was discovered that the interaction between photons and deuterons causes the Coulomb barrier is not static, that has of oscillations in different directions within the lattice. So we can conclude that this phenomenon of cold fusion that breaks new ground in modern nuclear physics. In recent years, over 20 years, have seen thousands of experiments and theoretical models to explain the phenomenon of fusion at low energy (LENR) in specialized heavy hydrogen systems. We can say that a new possible way to obtain nuclear energy without waste is emerging. Nevertheless in spite of experimental contributions, the theoretical framework is not known. In this work, we try to explain the deuteron-deuteron reactions within palladium lattice by means of the coherence theory of nuclear and condensed matter. The coherence model of condensed matter affirms that within a deuteron-loaded palladium lattice there are three different plasmas: electrons, ions and deuterons plasma. Then, according to the loading percentage x = D/Pd, the ions deuterium can take place on the octahedrical sites or in the tetrahedral in the (1,0,0)-plane. In the coherence theory it is called ?-plasma the deuterons plasma in the octahedral site and ? -plasma which in tetrahedral. We propose a general model of effective local time-dependent deuteron-deuteron potential, that takes into account the electrons and ions plasma oscillations. The main features of this potential are extracted by means of many-body theory considering the interaction deuteron-phonon-deuteron. In fact the phonon exchange produces a attractive component between two deuteron within the D2 molecular. This attractive force is able to reduce the inter-nuclear distance from about 0.7 to 0.16 ?. It means that the lattice strongly modifies the nuclear environment with respect to free space. In this way according to deuterons energy, loading percentage and plasma frequency we are able to predict high o low tunneling probability. The fusion rates (s-1) computed vary from 10^-70 to 10^-17 and also a set of other mechanism, which could be enhanced these values, are proposed. In this way we hope that by means of this approach in the future will be possible to realize and control the nuclear exothermic reactions that take place in the condensed matter in order to obtain clean energy.","Frisone, F.",BiberianJPjcondensedg.pdf,Nuclear Exothermic Reactions in Lattices Pd: A Theoretical Study of d-d Reaction,J.

I now realize that in the meantime many new positive results have been published which can not be pushed aside quite so easily. Two reviews, currently in the course of publication, were very helpful and yielded much information on the present situation. These are the reviews of M. Srinivasan and E. Storms.

Relativistic equations were used, and the interaction of particles was considered Coulombic without taking into account magnetic effects. About 104 stories were modeled, each of them containing up to 100 collisions of free electrons with a hydrogen atom. The total number of simulated atoms that experienced collisions was ~ 10^6. Dynamic modeling revealed the formation of neutral particles consisting of protons (deuterons) with an electron rotating around them in nonstationary, close to elliptical orbits with an apogee to a distance of less than 10^-11 cm and to a perigee of ~ 10^-12 cm. These particles, which are continuously changing in size and shape, are up to 3 to 4 orders of magnitude smaller than ordinary hydrogen atoms, and 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than neutrons. Such nonstationary hydrogen miniatoms can exist for a short time (on our estimate, up to ~ 10^-12 sec.) in the environment of free electrons of metals, easily move in them and, like neutrons, approach the nuclei of isotopes of hydrogen or other elements at a distance at which nuclear fusion reactions or transmutation of elements are possible due to the tunneling effect.

A LEC converts the internal energy within the lattice of some materials, such as palladium, or of gases occluded within the lattice, such as hydrogen or deuterium, into ionizing radiation and electrical energy. Experiments include tests where the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the LEC were measured when an external voltage/current was applied, as well as other I-V tests where the spontaneous LEC voltage was measured as a function of temperature and resistance. LEC voltage and current has been shown to increasewith increased temperature. The electrical power produced by a LEC is similar to that produced by a nuclear battery however, a LEC does not require radioactive materials. While the energy levels produced to date are several orders of magnitude below those required formost power sources, the calculated flux of ionizing radiation necessary to produce the experimentally measured voltage and currentwould require the equivalent of several curies of radiation.

In the melted cathode, the data of which are reported, no 4He was found at the achieved sensitivity. X-ray film, positioned at 50 mm from the cell, roughly gave the image of the cathode through spots. Extended considerations have been made to explain this evidence on the basis of the bundle nature of the cathode. From these considerations, the energy of the radiation and the total energy associated to it have been estimated as 89 keV and 12 kJ, respectively.

Initially, an attempt was made to replicate the work at NRL in collaboration with MHI. When replication proved difficult, another set of experiments were conducted at MHI in three sets consisting of two control blanks and one positive foil (that should have transmuted Cesium to Praseodymium) per set. Foil samples were split for analysis at both NRL and MHI. Extensive analytical work was performed to characterize the foils and the blanks. When extracted at MHI, low nanogram amounts of Pr were found by ICP-MS on 3 of 3 foils that should have had Pr whereas the 6 controls were blank. Split solutions of these extracts were also tested independently at NRL and the presence of Pr was confirmed. The Pr found did not have the characteristic rare earth contamination expected if the Pr was from the environment and thus looked like it was produced in the experiment. Unfortunately, we could not find Pr at NRL (even at trace levels) on our split foil samples no matter what extraction method was employed. After considering and evaluating several unlikely scenarios for these disparate results, we visited MHI and participated in the extraction process on new foils. These extracts were blank when tested at both laboratories. Environmental samples were obtained at various locations where samples were handled. Pr was found in large amounts at one location used in sample preparation and this Pr had the signature of pure material rather than an inadvertent contaminate. No record of how it got there could be established. Other rare and characteristic impurities also were found in the extracts from MHI that were present in the laboratory environment. Thus, we concluded that the transmutation of Cs to Pr when deuterium permeated MHI?s multilayer structure could not be firmly established, as contamination during the foil production or during the foil analysis could not be ruled-out. The design of the replication experiments, the lessons learned, and the results will be discussed.","Grabowski, K.

The improved prospects of LENR in the past few years are indicated by the significant numbers and varied locations of researchers in several countries, a large body of accumulated evidence, major advances in explanation and theory development, and recent favourable occurrences, including a plethora of proposed energy-producing devices. The changing landscape creates policymaking opportunities for supporting LENR to realize its potential benefits, planning proactively to deal with anticipated adverse secondary impacts, and integrating the updates in a comprehensive policy program. The first policymaking opportunity, updates of current policies for LENR support, may best be accomplished in a framework of evidence-based policymaking. The level of evidence for the existence of LENR is at least a preponderance of evidence (greater than 50% probability). There may even be clear and convincing evidence (greater than 70%). Correspondingly, the policy response should be at least reinstatement and research comparable to other emerging energy technologies. Enhanced support, perhaps on a par with hot fusion, is indicated if there is clear and convincing evidence. The second policymaking opportunity related to LENR?s changing landscape is to address potential adverse secondary impacts with proactive planning. Broad deployment of LENR for energy supply may be expected to have major secondary impacts as a disruptive technology. Direct impacts will take place on all phases of the energy chain ? supply, transport, storage, and consumption. Indirect impacts will be felt most by the components of society that are closely tied to the energy cycle, such as sectors of the workforce and energy-based communities. Technology assessment is a mature and readily available methodology for identifying secondary impacts and developing mitigative measures. A third policymaking opportunity is to integrate LENR policy updates that are needed as demonstrated by its changing landscape. Policies for mitigating adverse secondary impacts, for example, can be formulated based on policies for LENR support and the resulting pace of its development and deployment. New and updated policies may also be integrated at the national and international level and between the public and private sectors. The public interest will be served by update and integration of LENR policies for its development and mitigating its impacts. However, many challenges must be overcome to achieve the update and integration objectives. The world desperately needs new sources of clean and inexpensive energy. The case of cold fusion would perhaps be a curiosity in the history of science if the stakes were not so high.","Grimshaw, T.",BiberianJPjcondensedr.pdf,Integrated Policymaking for Realizing Benefits and Mitigating Impacts of LENR,J.

With this formulation, we have found that a lattice vibrational mode cannot accept a large energy quantum, as the coupling is not sufficiently nonlinear.

We review the generalization of the resonating group method for reactions in vacuum to include solid state effects, and discuss implications for experiment. Phonon exchange in the case of a much simpliﬁed scalar Gaussian nuclear model is reviewed. The coupling of reactions at different sites is explored, and connections are made with recent experiments on alpha emission. The fastest site-other-site reactions are null reactions in which fusion reactions and their inverses are coupled. A consideration of these processes leads to the conclusion that compact states should be present stabilized by phonon exchange, and that these may be responsible for anomalies in recent beam experiments with metal deuterides.

The model is extended to include relaxation effects, and it is found that one would not expect to find coherent effects associated with tunneling in the case of two deuterons in a metal lattice.

A series of concepts, which were raised and partly elaborated, are presented. The key concept is a three-body mechanism, where one of the nuclei serves as a catalyst for the reaction of the other two. In these reactions, a single fusion product or two outgoing nuclei are created, along with the recoiled catalytic nucleus. They carry off the nuclear energy released, and heat the surrounding materials by multiple collisions. Importantly, they produce high energy ! radiation with negligible probability. So, this three-body idea solves the two major riddles of LENR, that nuclear reactions can occur at ordinary temperatures and without emitting ! radiation. Cross sections and rates are calculated using standard quantum mechanics, and accepted nuclear and solid-state physics. Their dependence on relevant densities, and on the reacting and catalytic nuclei, are explicit. The theoretical ideas and the results of their elaboration are compared with diverse data from LENR experiments with considerable success.","Kalman, P.; Keszthelyi, T.; Nagel, D.

A survey of the literature indicates that palladium particles less than 2 nm in size can obtain a Pd/D loading near one at modest deuterium pressure. In hundreds of reactions, we have routinely prepared palladium nanoparticles inside an aluminosilicate matrix and have found that these systems produce up to 8 fold more heat with deuterium compared to hydrogen. Furthermore, a characteristic signature of a pressurization reaction is its reversibility -- the heat released upon pressurization should be absorbed upon evacuation. This reversibility is observed with hydrogen but not deuterium. Although we are still seeking conventional explanations for this excess heat, the anomalous heat does not appear to be explained by impurities in the deuterium gas nor other simple chemical or physical sources. The selection and preparation of the particles, the experimental set-up, and results will be discussed.","Kidwell, D.; Rogers, A.; Grabowski, K.

We propose an alternative theoretical model for the ABC fusion based on Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) mechanism. Our theoretical model yields two main predictions.? The first prediction is that the Coulomb interaction between two charged bosons is suppressed for the case in which number N of charged bosons is large, and hence the conventional Gamow factor is absent. The second prediction is that the fusion rate depends on the probability of the BEC ground state occupation instead of the conventional Gamow factor.? This implies that the fusion rate will increase as the temperature of the system is lowered since the probability of the BEC state is larger at lower temperatures.? These predictions imply that the ABC fusion may be achievable at lower temperatures. A number of key improvement to acoustic cavitation experiments are proposed to check these predictions as well as the results of other experiments.","Kim, Y.

This strange effect was distinctly confirmed by the observation that with the TiT0.0035-preparation the radioactivity decreased 12.5 times stronger than the release of tritium (2,3,4). A quite independent proof of the strong decrease of λ of tritium could be obtained by a thermodynamic evaluation of the heating experiment with the TiT0.0035-preparation: Assuming that λ of tritium decreases to zero or nearly zero in a part of the tritons enables the determination of the number of tritons with normal λ, nT and the number of tritons with λ ≈ 0 nTo, both as a function of temperature. Then quite surprising nT and nTo follow the laws of chemical equilibria in distinct parts of the experimental A = f(T)-function.

This is an example of a quantum state, which is mathematically acceptable in the sense of being square integrable and having a finite binding energy but yet is rejected as unphysical due in part to the point-nucleus nature of the model. Then the Dirac equation is studied for the existence of states which are similarly mathematically acceptable but whose physical acceptability requires physical judgment. States of Landau symmetry are found which meet these criteria. The existence of states of ambiguous physical interpretation for both the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations depends on using a point-nucleus versus a finite-nucleus potential model. On using a realistic model for the charge distribution of the proton, a Klein-Gordon state is found in the binding range of 5 keV, but no state is found for the Dirac equation.","Ritchie, B.",BiberianJPjcondensedj.pdf,Compatibility of Hydrino States and Quantum Mechanics,J.

The hydrogen Binuclear Atom, a model proposed 25 years ago, is a metastable configuration in which the two nuclei are held together at a very short distance in an atom-like configuration. This should be a distinctive configuration of the hydrogen molecule where nuclei are characterized by a high kinetic energy, and nuclear motion is coupled with electronic motion. This is a completely different model from the usual Born-Oppenheimer picture of atoms and molecules we are used to, where nuclei oscillate about their equilibrium positions and electronic motion is decoupled from the nuclear one.

More than three hundred LENR papers from 1989 to 2008 that reported excess energy were acquired and reviewed to extract quantitative results and other information. Excess energies and cell volumes were found in 17 papers. These data were used to compute eV per water molecule values. Most experiments showed excess energy outputs that would lead to ratios below the vibrational energy of water molecules at room temperature (0.04 eV/molecule). However, 65% of the papers, which reported both excess energies and cell volumes, indicated values significantly higher. The highest  reported value was 42.6 eV/molecule. Eleven ratios are far beyond what is plausible for water to be the source of anomalous heat. Therefore, it is concluded that some unknown rearrangement of water molecules in many LENR experiments is not the source of excess heat.","Al Katrib, A. K.; Nagel, D.

In fact, most of the experiments and deductions of material sciences are based on the assumption that space?time is flat and isotropic (Minkowskian). After discarding this assumption, a theory of Deformed Space Time (DST) was developed in the last decades. Following this theory, experimental results were obtained which are not predicted by the Standard Model. The DST-theory concerns the fundamental interactions and in particular the nuclear ones, that can play the main role in the observed anomalies. In order to consider a nuclear reaction as a DST-reaction, four main phenomenological features were deduced: occurrence of an energy threshold; change of atomic weight; absence of gamma radiation; anisotropic emission of nuclear particles in intense beams having a very short life span. From the experimental point of view, rather than looking for fortuitous events that produce the conditions for DST-reactions, more systematic research can be undertaken by following the above reported four general rules. In particular, the occurrence of thresholds can correspond to a latency time, required to reach the energy density necessary to deform space?time. The absence of gamma radiation cannot be considered as a sign that nuclear reactions are not present; in fact, in absence of detected gamma radiation, elements were found which were not present before the reaction. The nuclear emissions, which are anisotropic and impulsive, can be difficult to detect with the traditional methods, thus inducing incertitude on the occurring reactions. Finally, a rapid variation of energy density is an experimental common factor of DST-reactions. Thus, the DST-theory can be the leading theory in the design of the experiment and in the interpretation of its experimental results.","Albertini, G.; Rogante, M.",BiberianJPjcondensedzc.pdf,Beyond Hydrogen Loading,J.

Upon commissioning of one unit, the hydraulic transient in the draft tube during load rejection above 75% was excessive. It was apparent that the guide vane closing law that had been adopted would result in water column separation during load rejection at full power. Tests with a slower closing rate showed that the risk of column separation was reduced, but a violent surge developed in the draft tube close to maximum over speed.

Briefly, the lattice parmeter calculated from Bragg peaks obtained from diffraction by metal near the surface of the sheet opposite the charging surface increases at a rate that is extremely low in view of the known diffusivity of hydrogen in the metal. In addition, different Bragg reflections lead to different values of lattice parameters and to different time dependencies; also, grain rotation occurs. The suggested mechanism for these phenomena involves large amounts of plastic deformation caused by stress generation caused by hydrogen concentration gradients.

In the simulation analysis of the tetrahedron cage, it is indicated that the titanium pair causes the deuterium atom to have ligancy 2 in the cage with two hydrogen atoms. If neutron generation occurs, we can deduce from the past experimental results that it occurs after a small increase of kinetic energy of deuterium atoms. This suggests that the quantity of neutron generated may increase if we can give kinetic energy to the adsorbed deuterium atoms in the titanium crystal by another means other than a temperature rise, at a suitable temperature and pressure.

Recent simulation analysis results, related to the predicted cluster or cell models of deuterium atoms adsorbed in titanium crystal, together with the related calculations by Coulomb formula and Yukawa formula were investigated. Coulomb force working between deuteron?deuteron (d?d) particles is compared with the nuclear force working between them. The change of the force to each of them is evaluated in accordance with the distance between them, near the surface of the atomic nucleus. Taking into account the results of previous studies, it seems that nuclear fusion will occur occasionally without adding any specified energy. We think that there is a possibility of a collision of free deuterons through the medium of a negative charge in a deuterium atom in ligancy 2. On the other hand, we think that if a suitable amount of energy, which is far smaller than that of high temperature nuclear fusion, such as the irradiation of the alternative electromagnetic wave, for example, is supplied to adsorbed deuterium atoms and desorbed deuterons in the titanium (Ti) shavings packed in the experimental cylinder under a pressurized or evacuation condition with a suitable temperature rise, then there also will be a higher probability of nuclear fusion being achieved.","Asami, T.; Giorgi, G.; Yamashita, K.; Balanzoni, P.",BiberianJPjcondensedq.pdf,"Study on the Phenomenon Reported ""Neutron Generation at Room Temperature in a Cylinder Packed with Titanium Shavings and Pressurized Deuterium Gas"" (3)",J.

The force of each of them was evaluated in accordance with the distance between them, near the surface of an atomic nucleus. As a result, it was found that there were two regions. One of them is the stronger Coulomb force region and the other is the stronger nuclear force region. At the boundary of these regions, both forces are equal to each other. It appears that if the adsorbed deuterium atom in ligancy 2 and the desorbed free deuteron are placed in a suitable magnetic field, both the electron in the adsorbed deuterium atom in ligancy 2 and the desorbed free deuteron are influenced by the magnetic lines of force. The author deemed that there might be an aperture of the energy barrier. If there is the aperture of such an energy barrier, there must be a possibility for two deuterium nuclei to collide and produce nuclear fusion without being under tremendous high temperatures. To confirm this possibility, the author has studied and evaluated the behavior of the charged particle and calculated the working force under the homogeneous and stable magnetic field. As an example, under this influence in the magnetic field, the working force, the behavior of a deuteron, a co-existing deuteron and an adsorbed deuterium atom in ligancy have been analyzed. However, the working force to the particle, the Lorentz force, is very small compared to the Coulomb force. The motion of the charged particle and the electron orbital plane in an adsorbed deuterium atom in ligancy 2 in the magnetic field is the preferable direction. To analyze the possibility of nuclear fusion at room temperature, it is thought that a more advantageous circumstance than that proposed in this paper should be prepared.","Asami, T.",BiberianJPjcondensedz.pdf,Study on the Phenomenon Reported ?Neutron Generation at Room Temperature in a Cylinder Packed with Titanium Shavings and Pressurized Deuterium Gas?

That is, the ""optimal"" range of wavelengths includes that discovered by Letts and Cravens, but because of the possibility of multi-photon reactions it does not uniquely single out their 680 nm as best, which would require a more detailed model (including e.g. cathode temperature) than provided by the simplified 1993 theory.","Bass, R.

The necessary presence of deuterium suggests that fusion reactions can be partially or totally responsible for the generation of excess heat.Experience has shown neutron emission to be sporadic and very weak; on the other hand tritium was found in small but detectable amounts. Moreover if tritium accumulates in the solution it can be comfortably measured postmortem.Two experimental campaigns were performed:The first one in Frascati having as main objective the detection of tritium excess. Particular care was exerted to avoid any tritium and hydrogen contamination.The second one at the Texas A & M University in the framework of a scientific collaboration, having as objective the excess of heat and tritium measurement.","Bertalot, L.; Bettinali, L.; De Marco, F.; Violante, V.; De Logu, P.; Dikonimos, T.; La Barbera, A.",BertalotLanalysisof.pdf,Analysis of Tritium and Heat Excess in Electrochemical Cells With Pd Cathodes,"Second Annual Conference on Cold Fusion, ""The Science of Cold Fusion""","1,991",1,2003-04-30,"Pd, D2O, heat+, tritium-, neutron-, electrolysis, pulse loading, ICCF-2, negative",,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the correlation of HE with some features of the experiment seemed to be well established, the most convincing of which is the threshold of the D/Pd ratio. What is yet not quite clear is how to obtain a high D/Pd ratio, since this feature seems to depend both on the material and on the procedures adopted for the electrolysis. In this paper we will propose a novel approach to this problem, which permits us to correlate HE with other features of the experiment. In particular, we try to study the transport of matter across the palladium lattice during the electrolysis. A model proposed by two of us (ADN and VV), and presented at this Conference, helps to interpret the experimental results, and gives interesting hints for future research.","Bertalot, L.; De Marco, F.; De Ninno, A.; La Barbera, A.; Scaramuzzi, F.; Violante, V.; Zeppa, P.",IkegamiHthirdintera.pdf,Study of Deuterium Charging in Palladium by the Electrolysis of Heavy Water: Search for Heat Excess and Nuclear Ashes,"Third International Conference on Cold Fusion, ""Frontiers of Cold Fusion""","1,992",1,2018-12-04,"Pd, D2O, heat+., electrolysis, oneside electrolysis, ICCF-3, D2",106,112,,,,,,,,,

A proton conductor layer (poly-ethyleneoxide) (PEO) and phosphoric acid) is deposited between the cathode and the two anodes. The system is placed in a chamber filled with deuterium gas, at a temperature of 75?C. At first, deuterium fills the two anodes up to D/Pd = 0.48 measured by pressure decrease. Then a voltage is applied between cathode and anodes, and the cathode gets loaded by D+ electrochemical migration through the solid state electrolyte. Correspondingly, the pressure decreases. Loadings of up to 0.73 have been obtained. When voltages are reversed, the cathode deloads, and the pressure in the chamber increases. This method is well suited to measure over-potentials and absolute loadings. The input power is very low, since the production of D+ ions entering the cathode is close to 100% whereas in liquid electrolyte cells, a small fraction of the ions produced is absorbed by the cathode. Therefore excess heat measurement is easily detected.","Biberian, J.

At this value damage begins to be seen in the SEM photographs of the interior of the electrodes. Tritium formation became detectable at an overpotential (η) of about 0.4 V. The reaction occurs in two consecutive steps: the first is a Volmer-Tafel reaction which occurs when the overpotential is less than 0.3 V. But as the measured coverage θD approaches unity, the deuterons begin to discharge onto the adsorbed deuterium (Heyrovsky mechanism). The second (consecutive) step leads to the tritium formation via a neutron transfer from the electrode to the Pd-D bond which at this stage (near to full occupancy by D) is relatively weak. The ready availability of neutrons in the surface region of the metal catalyst is rationalized in terms of the high electron concentration associated with the surface and he presence of D arriving from D2O in the solution: e- + D+ = 2 neutrons + a neutrino. The model is applied to two anomalies which have troubled this reaction.

His reputation grew at a time (1950-1960) when electrochemistry was a popular subject for university research. British Electricity saw their chance to get a star performer down to Southampton University as professor, so they paid for a chair for a person who could attract research support and found that F could fill the job, although it was open to other candidates. Fleischmann occupied the chair for only a few years, less than had been foreseen, and retired from university life some years before it is usual. By this time he already was a Fellow of the Royal Society and also a director of the Max Planck Institute in Berlin. Fleischmann made a colleague of Stanley Pons, head of the Chemistry Department in the University in Utah. Pons (P) was of independent means and could fund research which the two of them might think out together. Fusion means coming together and F saw in electrochemistry a high performance way whereby this might be done. What they found was that the heat evolved in a particular deuterium solution when they passed current through it was larger than it should have been according to known chemical theory. In addition to this they observed some neutrons. They suggested that the extra heat was due to an unknown nuclear reaction. What was unusual about the next step was that F&P got on the McNeil-Lehrer Hour and announced that they had been the first to carry out a nuclear reaction in the cold. After a short time, the nuclear chemists of the world turned against F&P and said that their claims must be all nonsense. The anti-Fleischmann opinion expressed at meetings was so great that they decided that it would be a good thing to escape to some other country. They had a friendship with a very wealthy man, Mr. Toyota, and he had already founded some laboratories in the South of France. He offered F and P laboratory space there and they could move their operation to it free of the negative atmosphere which reigned in America. At first the news which came from the laboratory in France was good. Alas, this was not maintained and after two years they split up and P retired to live in France whilst F retired to Tisbury in the U.K. But F?s creativity would not lie down and he was soon to apply something new, Quantum Electrodynamics. He made a colleagueship with a well-known Italian physicist Preparata. However, fate was not kind to F and he discovered that he was suffering from Parkinson?s disease. This is a slow disease but it?s incurable. However, for a couple of years F continued to attend meetings and make intelligent remarks at them. He died on 3 August 2012. Was F a brilliant theorist who did not have time to realize his true vision or had Jack the Flash, his nickname, flashed too much?

There have been attempts to explain anomalous heat by deuteron?deuteron nuclear fusion in the Pd lattice while the search for radiation was unsuccessful which indicated that the origin of the excess heat is unknown. Despite the unknown origin of the excess heat, Pd system is in the core of the research for energy production. The excess heat has been demonstrated by using calorimeters that are well characterized. However, these measurements are not able to provide detailed information about a localized heat rather than a heat from a large area. A new method is demonstrated to investigate an excess heat from Pd electrode loaded with deuterium or hydrogen. It is capable of measuring a small amount of heat generated in a localized area with a sub-micrometer resolution by fluorescence imaging with temperature sensitive fluorescence dyes. Considering quantum yield, photostability, and thermal stability, rhodamine 6G (R6G) is selected for temperature sensor along with a polymer, Poly MethylSilsesquioxane (PMSSQ). The thermal quenching of fluorescence resulted in a decreased temperature over time with heat generation. We envisioned that this new method of the temperature measurement provided a novel diagnostic tool for localized excess heat which was not detectable by calorimetry due to intrinsic disability.","Bok, S.; Mathai, C; Gangopadhyay, K.; Gangopadhyay, S.; Azizi, O.; He, J.; El-Boher, A.; Hubler, G.

They were manufactured during the 17th and 18th centuries, and kept in the Germanischen National Museum in Nuremberg in Germany. We did both nondestructive chemical and isotopic analysis. Silver has two stable isotopes, and our measurements indicate that the silver of all the coins have natural isotopic composition. We conclude that the silver contained in these coins is not of artificial origin. This does not prove that alchemists did not succeed in transmuting metals, but we have shown that the silver of these six coins is most likely of natural origin.","Bottollier-Curtet, H.; Koberl, O.; Combarieu, R.; Biberian, J.

A very simple calculation is used, which involves a bond between two inter-nucleon up and down quarks. This simple calculation does not depend on the type or mechanism for the bond. Furthermore, this simple calculation does not specify the shape or structure for the nucleus. This calculation only examines the energy of all possible up-to-down inter-nucleon bonds that may be formed within a quantum nucleus. A comparison of this total energy is made to the experimental binding energy with excellent results. The potential significance of this finding is discussed.","Bowen, N.

By examining the electromagnetic energies and forces, many questions about nuclear behavior can be answered and many insights into the nucleus can be gained. Previous theoretical models for the nuclear force include only the Coulomb electric force of the protons, but with little or no consideration of the electromagnetic characteristics of the quarks. By incorporating the electromagnetic energies and forces into nuclear theory, this model has been able to achieve predictions of binding energy better than any previous model, doing so by using only one variable instead of five.

The shell model of the nuclear force is considered to be the fundamental and foundational model of the nuclear force -- that force which binds the nucleons together in a nucleus. The shell model was developed in the late 1940s, and it is based on the experimentally known nuclear data at that time, data which supported the concept of nuclear shells. Most textbooks, even the current ones, present this experimental data from the 1940s when discussing the validity of the shell model. However, a large amount of nuclear data has since been collected over the past 70 years, and a re-examination of the experimental data in support of the shell model is long overdue.","Bowen, N.

By examining the electromagnetic energies and forces, many questions about nuclear behavior can be answered, and many insights into the atomic nucleus can be gained. Previous theoretical models for the Nuclear Force include only the Coulomb electric force of the protons, but with little or no consideration of the electromagnetic characteristics of the quarks. By incorporating the electromagnetic energies and forces into nuclear theory, this model has been able to achieve predictions of binding energy better than any previous model, doing so by using only one parameter instead of the five parameters used in the semi-empirical Weizs?cker formula of the Liquid Drop Model. The Electromagnetic Model unifies the Nuclear Force to the Electromagnetic Force. The Electromagnetic Model of the Nuclear Force includes the calculation of electromagnetics of the quarks, and by doing such, it is shown that the Nuclear Force is significantly influenced by the Electromagnetic Forces of the quarks. This paper, Part II of this series, illustrates the ground state configurations of the atomic nuclei, showing the basic segments of how the protons and neutrons cluster together, and how these segments bond to form larger atomic nuclei. A pattern emerges for the ground state configurations due to the uniformity of the electromagnetic laws. Diagrams are shown for this basic pattern, for both stable and radioactive atomic nuclei. By incorporating the electromagnetic energies and forces into nuclear theory, this model has been able to achieve not only excellent predictions of binding energy, but the ability to answer many other questions regarding the various behaviors of atomic nuclei.","Bowen, N.
