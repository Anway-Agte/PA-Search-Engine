Introduction

Our 1994 publication [1] presented evidence of localized, microscopic surface
concentrations of gold and silver on palladium cathodes which had been electrolyzed in
an electrolyte containing either H2SO4 and D2O or H2SO4 and H2O. The unique
capabilities of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive
spectrometer (EDS) made it possible to locate concentrations of these elements on a
microscopic scale. Our experiments included the detection of excess heat. We suggested
that the excess heat and unexpected elements could be explained by the energy released
during transmutation of platinum to gold and palladium to silver in the presence of
thermal neutrons.

A previous study by another group also reported elemental anomalies on the surface of
palladium after electrochemical loading of deuterium [2]. A near surface enrichment of
rhenium and silver was detected by x-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS). These
elements are present as impurities in the starting palladium at levels (50 ppm Rh and 100
ppm Ag), well below the XPS detection limit. It is not clear why nickel, which is present
before electrolysis as an impurity at the 200-300 ppm level, was not similarly enriched to
a concentration which could be detected by XPS. This report does not include a bulk
analysis of a Pd cathode after electrolysis. The authors concluded that surface segregation
of Rh and Ag impurities is most likely due to the forcing current and time during long-
term electrolysis.

In another study by the same group [3], time-of-flight-secondary ion mass spectroscopy
(TOF-SIMS) measurements of the Pd blank (no electrolysis) and Pd electrolyzed in H2O
gave the natural abundances of the stable Pd isotopes. However, two samples
electrolyzed in D2O had more than 20% increases in Pd 106 intensities and decreases in
Pd 105 intensities. These researchers suggested the possibility that Pd 105 obtained a
neutron and became Pd 106. Although this SIMS research seemed promising, it was not
mentioned in a later publication from this group [2]. Apparently, this research was
terminated.

In 1994 we also published a report on the changes in surface topography and
microcomposition of a palladium cathode caused by electrolysis in acidified light water
[4]. A thin palladium cathode became bent and torn during electrolysis in acidified light
water. Localized changes in composition, including the possibility of the formation of
silver by neutron absorption, were reported.

Results of our SIMS study of Pd foils before and after electrolysis were presented in
1996 [5]. We found that there was an isotopic inversion on the surface of a Pd foil
cathode which had been electrolyzed in acidified heavy water. In the spectrum from the
control (unelectrolyzed Pd foil), the signal from Pd 106 (natural abundance 27.33 at.%)
was slightly greater than the signal from Pd 108 (natural abundance 26.46 at.%).

However, a SIMS spectrum from an electrolyzed Pd foil had a more intense signal from
Pd 108 than from Pd 106. The difference between these two abundances decreases with
increasing sputtering time. After sputtering for 50 minutes to a depth of about 0.3 μm,
these two isotopes have the same abundance.

The same report included data on excess thermal power (0.3 W maximum) which was
observed from electrolysis of acidified heavy water with a Pd foil cathode, compared
with an identical cell containing a Pt cathode. After about 70 hours of electrolysis and a
dormant period of 75 days, the cells were again electrolyzed. In 5 consecutive
experiments totaling 20 hours over a period of 2 weeks the cell with the Pt cathode
produced as much as 0.3 W excess thermal power compared with the cell containing a Pd
cathode.

In 1997 we published the results of electrolysis experiments with titanium cathodes [6].
One experiment produced about 1 W excess thermal power compared with a control.
Geiger-Mueller counters used to monitor radiation emitted by the cells showed no
significant difference compared to background. LiF chips sealed in plastic and placed
inside the cells before electrolysis also showed no significant difference compared to
background. The Ti cathodes was examined before and after electrolysis, using SEM and
EDS. A new microscopic feature on a cathode after electrolysis contained appreciable
vanadium, one atomic number higher than titanium, just as silver is one atomic number
higher than palladium and gold is one atomic number higher than platinum.

In the same publication [6], we presented evidence of microscopic, time-dependent
changes in fibers on the surface of a Pd cathode which had been electrolyzed about 6
months earlier. Distinct changes in the morphology of one of the fibers occurred in two
days during storage at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. An EDS spectrum of
a new, oval-shaped feature showed that it contained an appreciable amount of silver. A
spectrum from the same spot one month later suggested that silver was changing to
cadmium, which is one atomic number greater than silver. This is further evidence which
supports the possibility of transmutation.


Experimental methods

Palladium (AESAR stock # 11514) was cold rolled from 500 to 40 μm thickness. Each
cathode was prepared from a piece of this foil 2 cm long and 0.8 cm wide which was spot
welded to a Pt lead wire. The anodes were prepared in the same way, using Pt foil spot
welded to a Pt lead wire.

The electrolyte contained 20 ml D2O and 3.5 ml H2SO4 in one cell. A second cell
contained 20 ml deionized H2O and 3.5 ml H2SO4.. The heavy water and light water cells
were connected in series (Fig. 1).

Fig.. 1. The heavy water and light water cells are connected in series. Each cell has a Pd
cathode and a Pt anode. All heavy water cathodes bent toward their anode 45 to 90
degrees, but the light water cathodes bent toward their anode only slightly.

In one experiment the time of electrolysis was 6 minutes at a current density of about
0.25 A per cm2. After microscopy of the electrodes was completed, SIMS analysis was
performed on a control (no electrolysis) Pd foil from the same cold rolled strip, and on
the Pd cathodes from the light water and heavy water cells.

The instrument used for these analyses was a PHI II SIMS, Model 3500, linked to a
General Balzer 16 mm rod quadrupole mass spectrometer. Each sample was bombarded
with a 3 KV Cs ion beam which scanned an area of about 1.4 mm x 1mm. Pd was
sputtered from the cathode at the rate of about 0.1 nm per second. By sputtering for long
times, it was possible to obtain the relative abundances of the isotopes versus depth.

center – after H2O electrolysis; bottom – after D2O electrolysis.


Results and discussion

The uppermost graph in Fig. 2 gives the signal intensities for the three most abundant Pd
isotopes as a function of sputtering time for the control (no electrolysis) foil. As expected,
Pd 106 gives the highest signal intensity (counts per second CPS), Pd 108 is next, and Pd
105 gives the lowest signal intensity. There is no significant change in signal intensity
with increasing sputter time, i.e. with increasing depth into the sample. This is similar to
the three other depth profiles taken from other locations on the unelectrolyzed control
foil.

The SIMS results for the Pd foil which was electrolyzed for 6 minutes in H2O electrolyte
are given in the center graph, Fig. 2. After sputtering for 5 minutes, the relative intensities
are in proportion to their natural isotopic abundances, i.e., 27.3% for Pd 106, 26.5% for
Pd 108, and 22.3% for Pd 105. After 12 minutes of sputtering, the signal intensities are
almost constant for all three isotopes until sputtering was stopped after 25 minutes. Four
other regions on the same sample gave very similar depth profiles.

SIMS profiles were taken from nine different regions of the Pd foil which was
electrolyzed in D2O electrolyte. The bottom graph, Fig 2, shows a typical profile. After
sputtering for about 10 minutes, there is clearly an inversion in signal intensity : Pd 108
now has greater signal intensity than Pd 106, whereas the opposite is expected, based on
natural abundances. All nine of the depth profiles from this foil show this inversion. This
suggests the possibility that Pd 106 absorbs a neutron, and becomes Pd 107 which beta
decays to produce Ag 107, a stable isotope. Another possibility is that 106 PdD forms
during electrolysis. This would appear in the SIMS spectrum as mass 108, thus increasing
the Pd 108 signal and diminishing the Pd 106 signal.

The bottom graph in Fig. 2 shows that the difference in signal intensities of Pd 106 and
Pd 108 diminishes with increasing sputtering time. After 65 minutes, corresponding to a
depth of about 0.4 μm, the signals from these two isotopes are identical. It appears that
the process which caused the changes in signal intensities is confined to the outermost
layers of the cathode surface. This is not surprising because the time of electrolysis was

Fig. 3 shows a SIMS depth profile from a different area of the same Pd cathode after
electrolysis for 6 minutes in D2O electrolyte. The signal from Pd 106 is far less than
expected. It coincides with the signal from Pd 105 which has a natural abundance 5 at.%
less than Pd 105. The signal from Pd 108 is consistently greater than that from Pd 105
and Pd 106 throughout the 81 minute sputtering time. There is no tendency for merger of
the Pd 106 and Pd 108 signals, such as that shown in the bottom graph, Fig. 2.

SIMS profiles for 8 of the 9 analyzed areas of the heavy water electrolyzed Pd cathode
show that there is also an inversion in the abundance of Pd 104 (11.14 at.% natural
abundance) and Pd 110 (11.72 at.% natural abundance). Data for the control and for the
light water and heavy water electrolyzed Pd cathodes are given in Fig. 4. The signal from
Pd 110 is greater than the signal from Pd 104 throughout 25 minutes of sputtering, both
for the control (upper graph) and for the 6 minute H2O electrolyzed Pd cathode (center
graph). The lower graph gives data for the Pd cathode after electrolysis for 6 minutes in
D2O electrolyte. It shows that the signal from Pd 110 is only about half the intensity of
the signal for this isotope in the upper 2 graphs, whereas the signal from Pd 104 for this
cathode is only slightly less than that in the upper 2 graphs. The inversion is almost
constant throughout the 81 minute sputtering time. Its cause may have may have a similar
explanation to those suggested above for the 106/108 inversion.

In another experiment, Pd from the same stock was cold rolled from 0.5 to 0.35 mm
thickness. A cathode 25 x 23 x 0.35 mm 3 was prepared from this. Electrolyte was
prepared containing 6.7 g D2O : 1 g H2SO4 and about 0.02 g Ti per ml of solution.
Electrolysis was performed for about 6 hours per day for 8 days. Excess power compared
to a control cell was observed for every run. It ranged from 0.5 to 2.6 W. The average
was 1.8 W.

During electrolysis the Pd cathode bent toward the Pt anode to form a concave surface
facing the anode. After electrolysis both the concave and convex surfaces were analyzed
blind by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) scientists. The analyses
included SIMS, SEM, and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). SEM and AES data are
given in Figs. 5 and 6 and Tables 1 and 2.

areas have large concentrations of C, O, and N before and after sputtering. These
elements were also found on the light gray area as received, but not after sputtering.

Data for the convex side of the Pd cathode after electrolysis are given in Fig. 6 and Table

Carbon was not detected on this side of the cathode. After sputtering, oxygen and
nitrogen were not detected. Chlorine was detected on both light and dark gray areas.

Figs. 5 and 6 show that both sides of the Pd cathode contain a mixture of smooth, dark
gray areas in a matrix of mottled, light gray areas. As received, the outermost layers of
the concave side of the Pd cathode contain about 50 at.% C, but C was not detected on
the convex side. It is difficult to accept that this difference could be caused by
contamination. The main difference between the two sides is that the concave side had
higher current density during electrolysis. If C was deposited on the concave side, it
should have also been deposited on the convex side, but to a lesser extent.

The origin of the Cl on the convex side only is also puzzling. Again, contamination or
deposition during electrolysis is expected to affect both sides.

The SIMS data on the same Pd cathode after electrolysis does not contain any inversions
of isotopic abundance such as those in Figs. 2 – 4, but there are significant differences
compared with the control, a pure (99.999 %) Pd foil which had not been electrolyzed.
For example, there are no changes in isotopic abundance in the depth profiles for the
control. Fig. 8 shows the count rate for masses 107 and 109 for the convex side of the
electrolyzed Pd foil. The average count rate is about 50% greater for mass 107 than for
mass 109,

Fig. 7. Counts per second for the control Pd foil from masses 107 and 109. The count
rate does not change with increasing depth into the foil. The average counts per second is
about 22 for both masses.

Fig. 8. Counts per second versus sputtering time (seconds) for the convex side of the
electrolyzed Pd foil, which faced away from the anode during electrolysis. Compared
with the control, there is less overlap of the data for mass 107 (yellow) with the data for
mass 109 (blue). The average counts per second is about 30 for mass 107 and 20 for mass
The SIMS depth profiles for masses 107 and 109 from the concave side of the
electrolyzed Pd cathode are shown in Fig. 9. Here, it is apparent that the count rates for
both 107 and 109 decrease with increasing sputtering time, and the count rate for 107 is

electrolysis (concave side).

about double that of 109 throughout 1700 seconds of sputtering. There is no overlap of
the count rates from these two masses. At the start of sputtering the signal from mass 107
is about 90 cps, and this falls to about 35 cps at the end of sputtering.The signal from
mass 109 falls from about 75 cps to about 15 cps during the same time period.

Masses 107 and 109 are stable isotopes of Ag, so transmutation by absorption of
thermal neutrons is one possible explanation for the presence of these isotopes. Another
possibility is that PdH and PdD are formed. Then, 105 PdD would appear at 107.This
could be an explanation for the ratio 107/109 ~ 2 in Fig. 8, whereas the expected ratio is
~ 1.1 for Ag. However, if 105 PdD is present, then 108 PdH should also be present. This
would appear at mass 109 in the SIMS spectrum, and the 109 signal would be enhanced.
Fig. 8 shows that there is enhancement of the 109 signal for several hundred seconds
sputtering time compared with the 109 signal from the control in Fig. 7. Because there is
no change in abundance with depth into the control Pd foil and because the 107/109 ratio
is as expected, it seems likely that the signals from these two isotopes are due to Ag
impurity which is uniformly distributed throughout the control Pd foil.

Fig. 10 gives another example of changes in isotopic abundance on the concave surface
of the 0.35 mm thick Pd cathode with increase in sputtering time. At the surface, the ratio
of the isotopic abundance of 105 Pd to that of 104 Pd is about six, whereas the natural
abundance ratio for these two isotopes is about two. After rising initially, the abundances
of these two isotopes fall and converge, so that the abundance ratio is about 2.5

0.4μm.
after sputtering for about 550 seconds. On the convex side, the isotopic abundance of 104
and 105 Pd changes with increasing sputtering time, but the ratio 105 Pd / 104 Pd is
close to the natural abundance.


Summary and Conclusions

SIMS spectra from 40 μm thick Pd foil cathodes after electrolysis in H2O/H2SO4
electrolyte for 6 minutes show no significant changes in isotopic abundance
compared with the control which was not electrolyzed. However, Pd foil cathodes
electrolyzed in D2O/H2SO4 electrolyte had inversions in which the Pd 108 signal
exceeded the Pd 106 signal and the Pd 104 signal exceeded the Pd 110 signal. These
inversions may have been caused by the formation of PdD and PdH. For example,
106 PdD would appear at 108, thus increasing the abundance of Pd 108. Also, 102
PdD would appear at 104, thus increasing the abundance of Pd 104. Another
possibility is that transmutation to Ag occurred. This would require the presence of
thermal neutrons [7].

A much thicker Pd foil (350 μm thick) electrolyzed for 74 hours in D2O/H2SO4
electrolyte did not show inversions of isotopic abundance, but it did show significant
differences in the SIMS spectra compared with the control. The occurrence of weak
signals of almost the same intensity from the control at masses 107 and 109 suggests
that Ag is present as an impurity in the control. The SIMS spectrum from the concave
side of the electrolyzed Pd foil has about twice the intensity of the signal at mass 107
compared with mass109. Based on natural abundance, the ratio of the signals should
be 107/109 ~ 1.1, instead of the observed 2. Any attempt to explain these results
should include the effects of PdH and PdD which are formed during electrolysis. PdH
would appear in the SIMS spectrum at 107 and 109, but their ratio should be ~ 1, not
the observed 2. Another possibility is that transmutation to Ag occurred. Ag was
detected by EDS in localized concentrations on both sides of this Pd cathode after
electrolysis. Large concentrations of C on the concave side were detected by EDS
studies, in agreement with the AES results. EDS also detected C on the convex side
of the Pd cathode, but at much lower concentrations. This suggests that the C content
is related to the current density during electrolysis. The high C content is on the
concave surface which faced the Pt foil anode and therefore had much higher current
density than the convex surface, which faced away from the anode. The changes in
the SIMS spectra are also much greater on the concave side. Fig. 9 shows one
example. There are others, too numerous to present in this report.

Since 1989, there have been many other reports of anomalous elements resulting
from the interaction of metals with hydrogen isotopes [ 8-14]. The results reported
here add to that growing body of evidence.
