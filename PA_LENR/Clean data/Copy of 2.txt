1. Introduction 

The solution of H (or D) severely changes the lattice dynamics of Pd. In neutron-scattering experiments, for example, new H(D)-induced optical phonons were observed
with frequencies well above those of the original Pd-lattice modes, accompanied by a
considerable softening of these lattice modes (Rowe et a1 1974, Rahman et al 1976,
Drexel et al 1976, Springer 1978). In the present paper, we report on thermal expansion measurements in which we have studied the lattice anharmonicity of P-phase
Pd-H and Pd-D in the temperature range between 80 and 270 K. We determine, for
both the optical and acoustic phonon branches, an (average) Griineisen constant
which describes the anharmonicity of these respective parts of the phonon spectrum.
The Griineisen constant of the optical phonons is of particular importance in connection with the superconducting properties of Pd-H and Pd-D alloys (Ganguly 1973% b,
1976, Stritzker and Wiihl 1978).

The present experiments are the first thermal expansion measurements on Pd-H
and Pd-D alloys: previous measurements (at room temperature and below 30K
(Smith and White 1977)) were restricted to the isotope H. For two reasons we found it
important to perform measurements on both H and D. Firstly, thermal expansion,
isotopic differences in thermal expansion, and isotopic lattice-parameter differences
are effects that allow a uniform description in terms of lattice anharmonicities
(Leibfried and Ludwig 1961, Cowley 1968, Wipf 1975, 1976). We shall demonstrate
that such a description is consistent with our thermal expansion data, and with
previous measurements of isotopic lattice-parameter differences at 77 K (Shirber and 
Morosin 1975). Our second reason for performing measurements on both Pd-H and
Pd-D is that this combination allows the determination of two separate Gruneisen
constants for the optical and acoustic phonons; such a determination is not possible
from measurements made on only one hydrogen isotope. (In fact, the value given by
Smith and White (1977) for the Gruneisen constant of the optical phonons is based on
the assumption that the anharmonicity of the acoustic phonons does not change upon
H doping; we shall find from the present study that such an assumption is not entirely
correct.) 

In $2, we discuss the theoretical basis of the present study, deriving the equations
describing thermal expansion and isotopic lattice-parameter differences in the presence of lattice anharmonicities; we consider also to what extent these equations are
applicable. In 93, we present our experimental results; in particular, we discuss the
influence of the phase transformation below 80 K (‘SO K anomaly’ (Lewis 1967, Wicke
et al 1978)). In $4, we determine the Gruneisen constant of the H(D)-induced optical
phonons from the isotopic difference in thermal expansion, and we compare our result
with previous measurements of the isotopic lattice-parameter difference between
Pd-H and Pd-D alloys (Shirber and Morosin 1975). We discuss also the accuracy to
which this Gruneisen constant is obtained. Finally, in $ 5, we determine the Gruneisen
constant which describes the anharmonicity of the acoustic phonons. 


2. Theoretical background

Lattice anharmonicities cause thermal strain. For cubic systems, the thermal strain
can be written as (Leibfried and Ludwig 1961, Cowley 1968) where B is the bulk modulus, and p the number of (all) atoms per unit volume. The
brackets indicate an average over all phonon modes v. y” is the Gruneisen constant of
the phonon v; it describes the dependence of the phonon frequency 0” on the volume
I/ according to the equation u(w’, T) is the energy of the phonon mode $1 at the temperature T.
The thermal strain describes the relative increase of sample length (or lattice parameter) against a hypothetical value observed for immobile crystal atoms fixed in
positions which correspond to a minimum of the potential energy of the lattice.
The thermal expansion coefficient is then the temperature derivative of the thermal
strain. 

Equation (1) is commonly simplified by introducing an overall Gruneisen constant
y, defined by the weighted average . According to this definition, y can exhibit some temperature dependence. Using equation (4), equation (1) becomes. The above equations are derived using the so called quasiharmonic approximation
which is well justified in describing the effects of anharmonicity on lattice parameter
or sample length (Leibfried and Ludwig 1961, Cowley 1968). The physical content of
the equations is characterised as follows. (a) Thermal strains exist also at T = 0 K; this is due to the non-zero kinetic energy
of the vibrational ground states.
(b) Within the present description, all isotopic lattice-parameter differences are due
to isotopic differences in thermal strain. This results from the fact that the atom
positions that correspond to a minimum of the potential energy are isotope independent. In 44, we shall use this isotopic behaviour in order to compare our thermal
expansion data with previous results for the isotopic lattice-parameter difference
between Pd-H and Pd-D alloys (Shirber and Morosin 1975).
(c) The equations above are applicable to disordered and non-stoichiometric systems, as well as to systems with lattice defects (vacancies, interstitials, dislocations).
This is an important fact which allows the application of these equations to Pd-H(D)
alloys.
(d) The equations above neglect thermal expansion effects due to electronic excitations. Electrons and phonons cause thermal expansion in a ratio given roughly by the
respective specific heat contributions; therefore, the expansion due to electrons is
comparable to that due to phonons only at very low temperatures (below about 10 K).
In the present study, our data analysis is essentially restricted to results obtained
above 80 K, i.e. in a temperature range where electronic expansion effects are entirely
negligible in comparison with those due to phonons. Not to consider electronic expansion is, therefore, well justified. 
(e) The equations above do not describe dimension changes that accompany phase
transformations or ordering processes, Therefore, it seems doubtful that these equations can be applied to Pd-H(D) alloys in the temperature range below 80 K, in which
a phase transformation is observed ('50 K anomaly' (Lewis 1967, Wicke et a1 1978,
Anderson et a1 1978a,b, Blaschko et al 1978, C B Satterthwaite, private communication, Ellis et a1 1979)). Ordering processes can also occur without a phase transformation. For instance, a short-range repulsive H-H(D-D) interaction causes changes in
the (short-range) spatial H-H(PD) correlation, if the temperature is varied. Another
kind of ordering occurs if the H(D) atoms also occupy, with increasing temperature,
energetically less favourable types of interstices (e.g. tetrahedral sitest). In principle,
both of these effects can cause a dimension change that is not due to lattice anharmonicity. Therefore, to apply the above equations requires, in the following, the
assumption that these effects have no noticeable influence on thermal strain.
(f) For the present study, to apply the above equations it must be assumed that the
diffusive jumps of the H(D) have no significant influence on thermal expansion. This
does not seem to be a critical presupposition for the present measurements made
below 270 K (the jump frequencies are smaller than lo9 s-l (Volkl and Alefeld 1975, 1978)); however, for jump frequencies that are considerably higher, it is certainly not
possible to exclude a priori expansion effects of this origin. 

The phonon spectrum of Pd-H(D) alloys consists of two energetically well-separated parts, one consisting of high-frequency optical and the other of low-frequency
acoustic phonons (Rowe et a/ 1974, Rahman et a1 1976, Drexel et a/ 1976, Springer
1978). The optical phonons represent vibrations of essentially only the (light) H or D
atoms. Although there is, at higher H(D) concentrations, considerable dispersion in
the optical modest, we shall, in the following, associate these modes with an average
frequency oH and w, (for H and D, respectively). In $4, it will be shown that the
precise value chosen for U,(%) has no significant influence on the results of our data
analysis. In a unit volume with fid Pd atoms, there are 3fid acoustic phonons and
3cfid optical phonons, c being the H(D)/Pd atom ratio. Accordingly, considering the
contributions of the acoustic and optical phonons separately, we can write the thermal
strain E$ and &' in the presence of H and D as . The first term on the right-hand side describes the thermal strain caused by the
acoustic phonons (with frequencies mac). For these phonons, yac is the average Griineisen constant, with a similar definition to the one given in equation (4). The second
term takes account of the optical phonons. The Griineisen constant yH(yD) of these
phonons is again a (weighted) average over the Griineisen constants of all optical
phonons. 

From equation (6), the thermal expansion coefficient a&) in the presence of H(D)
is found to be In this equation, C,, is the specific heat (per unit volume) due to acoustic phonons
(Cat = 3fid(i?/8T)( u(waC, T))ac), and CH,D the specific heat due to optical phonons
(CH,D = kfid(il/aT)U(O)H,D, T)). Finally, we introduce an overall Gruneisen constant y, 
where C = C,, + CH,D is the total specific heat. The thermal expansion coefficient can
then be written. In $44 and 5, the Griineisen constants introduced above will be determined from our
measurements. 

The fact that the optical-mode frequency oH is larger than wD introduces isotopic
differences in thermal strain and thermal expansion. This can be realised by considering two limiting temperature regions. Under the condition that essentially only wH
and wD are isotope dependent, we find, at zero temperature, a thermal strain (or lattice
parameter) larger for Pd-H than for Pd-D alloys (equations (3) and (6)). This isotopic
difference becomes smaller with increasing temperature, and it disappears in the hightemperature limit. Accordingly, in order to compensate for the low-temperature deficit
in thermal strain, we can conclude that the thermal expansion is larger for Pd-D than for Pd-H. For Pd-H and Pd-D, an isotopic lattice-parameter difference in agreement
with these considerations was observed at 77 K (Shirber and Morosin 1975); the
present experiments will also show a corresponding behaviour in thermal expansion?. 


3. Experimental details

3.1 Samples and apparatus:
The samples consisted of H(D)-doped Pd rods (1.5 mm in diameter, 20 mm long, with
a Pd-purity of 99.5%). The H(D) doping was performed electrolytically (5%
HzS04 (D2S04) in H20 (D20); the current density at the sample surface was
5 A cm-2; the temperature of the electrolyte was 90°C; the loading times were of
several hours). During doping, the samples underwent some plastic deformation due
to stresses arising from inhomogeneous H(D) distribution (Lewis 1967). To inhibit
H(D) desorption after doping, the samples were sealed in a solution of 1 g J and 3 g KJ
in 100 ml HzOf; except for during the measurements, they were stored in liquid N2.
The H(D) concentrations were determined from the weight increase during doping
and by vacuum extraction from the amount of dissolved H(D) after the measurements
were completed; the accuracy of the concentrations determined was 0.02 H(D)/Pd
atom ratios.

Measurements were made on seven samples with concentrations between 0.69 and
0.82 H(D)/Pd atom ratios, and on pure Pd. The temperature range of the experiments
was between 9 and 270 K. The measurements were made with a mechanical dilatometer in which a variation of sample length causes a (small) rotation of a mirror
monitored via the deflection of a laser beam: the dilatometer was mounted in a
He-cooled cryostat§. 

3.2. Experimental results:
The results of our measurements are compiled in figures 1 and 2 and in table 1. Figure 1
shows, for four of our samples, the relative increase of sample length, AL/L,
observed on heating from 9 K up to the temperature indicated on the abscissa (9 K
was the lowest temperature of our measurements). Accordingly, the thermal expansion
coefficient is given by the slope of the individual data curves. Figure 2 is a compilation
of results obtained from all our samples. In this figure, the relative length increase
measured at four (indicated) temperatures is plotted versus the H(D) concentration of
the respective samples. Table 1 shows numerical results for the thermal expansion
coefficient a of pure Pd, PdHo.7 and PdDo.7, determined at 250 K. The table shows
also previous results for pure Pd (Johansson 1925, Bailey et a1 1969) and PdHo.7
(Smith and White 1977).

Our data were taken in heating cycles (heating speed 1 Kmin-I), and at least two
runs were made for each sample to check reproducibility. The experimental error,
6(AL’L). consists of two terms (6(ALIL) = k0.05 ALIL f 2 x lo-’). The first 5% error 
term (it is nearly always much larger than the second term) results from calibration
inaccuracies of the dilatometer. It is important to note that this error affects all the
data points by the same percentage. Therefore, when discussing differences in thermal
expansion between two samples (e.g. isotopic differences), the calibration error need
only be considered for the difference and not for the data values from which the
difference was taken. 

A discussion of our data requires differentiation between the temperature ranges
above and below about 80 K. Below this temperature, we find a relative increase of
sample length (or a thermal expansion) for comparable concentrations larger for Pd
doped with H than with D (the data of the D-doped samples are even smaller than
those for pure Pd). Such a behaviour differs completely from what we expect, according to our discussion in 52. However, what we need to consider is that, below 80 K, a
phase transformation is observed for Pd-H(D) alloys which is caused by ordering processes of the H(D) interstitialst ('50 K anomaly' (Lewis 1967, Wicke et al 1978,
Anderson et al 1978a,b, Blaschko et al 1978, Ellis et al 1979)). The occurrence of a
phase transformation implies that we do not know to what extent an observed thermal
expansion is due to thermal strains, or to this transformation. In fact, the unexpected
isotopic behaviour of the thermal expansion suggests strongly that this phase transformation is accompanied by isotope-dependent strains$ For this reason, it does not
seem possible to describe our thermal expansion data below 80 K solely by anharmonic effects; these data will, therefore, not be considered within the analyses made in
$54 and 5.

Next, we consider the temperature range above 80 K, in which our samples were in
pure p phase. In this temperature range, we observe a pronounced increase of thermal
expansion in the presence of H and D. The isotope effect is as expected from our 
considerations in $2; the thermal expansion is larger for Pd doped with D than with
H, if we consider comparable concentrations. The data obtained above 80 K will be
used for the quantitative analyses in the two following sections. 


4. The Griineisen constant of the optical modes 

4.1. Determination from the isotopic diflerence in thermal expansion:
In this section, the Gruneisen constant yH(YD) of the optical phonon modes is
determined from the isotopic difference in thermal expansion (figure 2), and for a H(D)
conentration c = 0.7. At first, we assume that isotopic differences in thermal strain
(equation (6)) are due only to different optical-mode frequencies oH and wD ; all other
quantities (fid, B, yac, mac and yH = yD) are assumed to be independent of the respective hydrogen isotope. The adequacy of this assumption will be discussed quantitatively in $4.3. 

Under the above conditions, the isotopic difference in thermal strain is calculated
from equation (6) to be This difference in thermal strain is not identical with the isotopic difference
(AL/L)H - (hL/L), in the relative increase of sample length shown in figure 2. Both
quantities differ by an additive and (above 80 K) temperature-independent constant K 
In the absence of the phase transformation below 80 K, K would simply be the
isotopic difference in thermal strain at 9 K. 

In figure 3, the two full curves A1 and A2 show plots of (AL/L), - (AL/L), versus
u(w,, T) - U(%, T), with the temperature T as an implicit parameter (the values of
(ALIL), - (AL/L), were obtained from figure 2). According to the above two equations, the slope of the curves yields the value of cfidyH/B. To demonstrate that the
slope, and thus the value obtained for yH, does not depend sensitively on the precise
value chosen for oH and wD, we show two plots A1 and A2 corresponding to two
different frequency sets for wH and %. The frequency sets are listed in table 2, and in
the caption of figure 3. These sets represent borderline estimates for the lower (Al) and
upper (A2) limits of the average optical-mode frequencies determined for PdD0.63 by
Rowe et a1 (1974), and for PdH0,63 by Rahman et al (1976). The ratio oH/wD is 15, as
observed in these experiments. From the practically identical slopes of the two plots
A1 and A2 (0.12 eV- '), we derive a value of 3.2 f 04 for the Gruneisen constant yH,
using 4.045 a for the lattice parameter (Shirber and Morosin 1975, Peisl 1978), and
1.81 x 10'l Nm-' for the bulk modulus Bt (Hoefsloot et a1 1980). As a result of the
accuracy considerations in $4.3, this value will later be slightly modified to give
yH = 3.0 0.7. 

4.2. Comparison with lattice parameter measurements:
As discussed in $ 2, isotopic lattice-parameter differences are caused by isotopic differences in thermal strain. From equation (lo), and using our result of 0.12 eV-' for
ch,y,/B, we can calculate isotopic lattice-parameter differences at any temperature.
At 77 K, we obtain for and 1.49 x lop3, using
the lower and the upper frequency sets specified in table 2. This result is in excellent
agreement with previous experiments in which, for 77 K and c = 0.7, the relative
lattice-parameter difference was measured to be about 1.2 x (Shirber and Morosin
1975). For comparison, at 300 K, we obtain a relative isotopic lattice-parameter difference between 0.6 x and 1.0 x again using the two frequency sets. For
c = 0.7, the relative increase of the lattice parameter due to H doping is 4.4 x 10-2. (Peisl 1978); the corresponding value for D is, therefore, smaller by a value of between
1.4 and 2.3%.

4.3. Accuracy considerations:
In $4.1, the Gruneisen constant yH was determined under the assumption that the
quantities fid, B, yac, mac and yH(YD) in equation (6) are isotope independent. Such an
assumption is certainly only approximately correct; for instance, for fid, we can
immediately conclude that (small) isotopic differences occur as a consequence of isotopic differences in the lattice parameter. In this section, we shall discuss what
influence we can expect on the value determined for yH(yD) due to isotopic differences
in the above quantities. 

At first, we consider isotopic differences between yH and yo, assuming the other
quantities fid, B, etc. remain isotope independent. Defining 7 = (yH + yD)/2, and
6 = (yH - yD)/(yH + yD), we can, from equation (6), write the isotopic difference in
thermal strain as. This equation must describe correctly two independent experimental results; the first
one being our thermal expansion data, and the second one the isotopic lattice-parameter difference observed at 77 K (Shirber and Morosin 1975). According to the two
previous sections, both experimental results are excellently described in the case
6 = 0; now, we show that such a satisfactory description disappears with increasing
isotopic differences between yH and yD . Consider the (relatively extreme)
case 6 = -0.1 (this means yH is about 20% smaller than yD). For this value of 6,
we show two plots (broken curves B1, B2) of (MIL), - (M/L), versus
(1 + 6)u(0,, T) - (1 - 6)u(%, T) in figure 3; B1 and B2 again specify the two limiting
frequency sets for toH and co,, (table 2). From the slope of the plot curves, we derive
now a value for y(7 = 2.4) which is 25% smaller than that obtained in $4.1. It is
obvious that, from figure 3 alone, we cannot exclude the possibility of an isotopic
difference 6 = -0.1. However, using the value obtained for cfidy/B (see figure 3), we
calculate relative isotopic lattice-parameter differences from equation (12) of
0.41 x (upper frequency set) at 77 K.
These values are far from the experimental value of approximately 1.2 x lov3
(Shirber and Morosin 1975); we can, therefore, conclude that an isotopic difference of
the discussed size (6 = -0.1) cannot exist. In addition, from the above considerations,
we can estimate an upper value of 5% for possible isotopic differences between yH and
yD, in order to obtain reasonable agreement between the experimental results for
thermal expansion and isotopic lattice-parameter differences. 

In table 3, we show the results of a quantitative estimate that we made concerning
the influence of possible isotopic differences in the other quantities above. The table
shows how much (in per cent) the value yH = 3.2 determined in $4.1 needs to be
modified in the case of isotopic differences (in per cent) in the quantities listed. Considering, for example, the bulk modulus B, table 3 indicates that a bulk modulus 1%
larger for PdH,,., than for PdDo., is required to decrease the value determined for yH
by 7.2%.

Table 3 was calculated using the Debye approximation for the acoustic part of the
phonon spectrum. For a given temperature, the average energy ( u(maC, T))ac (equation (6)) is then described by a single quantity, the Debye temperature e,,. Using this
approximation, we can calculate, from equation (6), the thermal strain in terms of the parameters fid, B, yac, ea,, yH,D and CO,~. Within a linear expansion, we can
additionally calculate how much the value yH = 3.2 determined in $4.1 differs from the
true value if (small) isotopic differences exist in fid, B, yac and ea, . Table 3 shows the
result of such a calculation made using yac = 3-0 (see $5) and ea, = 220 K. (This value
is suggested from neutron-scattering experiments (Rowe et a1 1974) in which, for
PdD0.63, acoustic-phonon energies were observed to be about 20% lower than those
of pure Pd; accordingly, it seems reasonable to assume e,, to be 20% smaller than the
Debye temperature of pure Pd (e&, = 275 K)). For fid, B, */H,D and oH,D, we used the
values discussed in $4.1. We note that the results shown in table 3 are not very
sensitive to the precise values chosen for these quantities.

From the isotopic lattice-parameter differences discussed in $4.2, fid can be calculated to be about 0.3% larger for PdDo.7 than for PdHo.,, within the temperature
range of our measurements. The bulk modulus B is possibly 0.5% larger for PdHo.7
than for PdDo.7 ; such an estimate can be made from isotopic differences in force
constants obtained in Born-von-Karman fits, given in the paper of Rahman et a1
(1976). According to table 3, these isotopic differences mean a true value for yH about
5% smaller (i.e. yH = 3.0) than that determined in $4.1. At present, it is not possible to
give a quantitative estimate about isotopic differences in yac and ea, ; however, it seems
reasonable to assume that these differences do not exceed the range of magnitude
discussed for fid and B. 

As a result of the present considerations, we conclude yH = yD = 3.0 f 0.7 to be
the most reliable value for the Gruneisen constant of the optical phonons; yH and yD
differ by less than 5%. The experimental error (k0.7) is increased compared to that
given in $4.1, in order to take account of possible isotopic differences as discussed. We
note that our previous conclusions about isotopic lattice-parameter differences ($4.2)
are not affected by the present considerations, as long as isotopic differences in fid, B,
yac and ea, do not exceed the range of magnitude discussed above.

4.4. Previous results:
From room temperature thermal expansion data measured on Pd-H alloys, a value of
yH = 3.6 was estimated for the Gruneisen constant of the optical phonons (Smith and
White 1977). This value was obtained under the assumption that the Gruneisen constant yac of the acoustic phonons is identical with that of pure Pd (ypd = 2.3). According to our results in $5 (yac = 3.0 & 0*5), this does not seem to be entirely correct. We
note that the data of Smith and White yield a yH in better agreement with the present
result, if the change of yac upon H doping is considered. 

Using superconductivity data for Pd-H alloys, a YH(YH = 1.2) considerably smaller
than our result was calculated by Ganguly (1973a). However, this value does not
necessarily need to be comparable with our result since the superconducting properties were measured (a) at higher H concentrations than our data, and (b) in a temperature range where, at least for our concentrations, ordering processes of the H interstitials are observed (Anderson et a1 1978a,b, Blaschko et a1 1978, Ellis et a1 1979). 


5. The anharmonicity of the acoustic modes 

First, we determine the overall Gruneisen constant 7, according to equation (9). At
250K, the specific heat (per unit volume) of PdHo., is calculated to be
C = 3.20 x lo6 J(Km3)-'. using the specific heat data of Mitacek and Aston (1963)t
and a lattice parameter of 4.045 A (Shirber and Morosin 1975, Peisl 1978). From our
thermal expansion coefficient (table l), and with a bulk modulus B = 1.81 Nm-'
(Hoefsloot et a1 1980), we then obtain 7 = 3.0 f 0.3. The experimental error of f0.3
takes into account the inaccuracies in our thermal expansion coefficient, and the
possibility of a 5% error in the value used for C and B. 

The present value of y differs somewhat from that obtained previously (i' z 2.6) by
Smith and White (1977). This difference is due only slightly to different values of the
thermal expansion coefficients (actually, the values agree within the quoted experimental errors); for the most part, it is because the values used by Smith and White for
the lattice parameter (4.009 A) and bulk modulus (1.71 x 10" Nm-'), differ from
those of the present calculation:. 

From equation (8), and from our results for yH and y, the Gruneisen constant of the
acoustic phonons is calculated to be yac = 3.0 & 0.5. Since yH and y are (accidentally)
equal, this calculation does not require knowledge of the fractions C,,jC and CHjC of
specific heat caused by acoustic and optical phonons; however, in order to determine
the experimental inaccuracy (f0.5), a rough estimate has been made for these fractions using the specific heat data of Mitacek and Aston (1963)s.
Our result for ;'Jc is considerably higher than the Gruneisen constant of pure Pd
(yPd = 2.3). We conclude, therefore, that the anharmonicity of the acoustic phonons
increases in the presence of H. 


6. Conclusions 

We have made thermal expansion measurements on /I-phase Pd-H(D) alloys. The
expansion is increased compared with that of pure Pd; it is larger for Pd-D than for
Pd-H. The Gruneisen constant of the H(D)-induced optical phonons is given by
3.0 .t 0.7; it is essentially isotope independent. The Gruneisen constant of the acoustic
phonons is given by 3.0 f 0.5, which is larger than the Gruneisen constant of pure Pd.
Thermal expansion and isotopic lattice-parameter differences can be described consistently by anharmonic effects.
