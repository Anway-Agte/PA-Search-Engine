1. Introduction

The Pd/H(D) system is historically the first that had attracted research activities [1] because it represents one of the most
transparent and instructive models for a metal–hydrogen system. Palladium hydride shows many interesting features,
most of them not explained yet.

Perhaps the most intriguing conundrum is the effective charge of hydrogen inside the lattice and whether it can
migrate under the action of an electric field. It has been shown by Alfred Cöhn [2] that the dissolved hydrogen get
ionized when it enters into the lattice and settle in its equilibrium position in ionic form. Ionization may actually occur
just at the surface of the crystal and ions reach their equilibrium positions later on [3].

Moreover, the Pd–H system exhibits a complex phase diagram: at room temperature and pressure hydrogen is in a
gas like situation within the Pd lattice when H/Pd≤ 0.02 (α-phase); increasing the loading a new phase, named β-phase,
emerges coexisting with the α-phase; in the β-phase hydrogen is confined in the octahedral sites of the Pd lattice. When
H/Pd ∼ 0.6, the b-phase extends to the whole lattice.

In Fig. 1, it is shown the Pd lattice where Pd atoms occupy the fcc (face centered cubic) positions. Two equilibrium
positions are allowed to the solute atoms: the octahedral position along the minimum distance between Pd atoms, and
the tetrahedral position at the center of a tetrahedron having four Pd atoms at its vertex. The octahedral sites correspond
to the minimum energy position of the empty Pd lattice, however, increasing the loading, the energy bands of PdH
undergo a severe modification.

Experimental evidence [4] shows that a new phase in which hydrogen migrates from octahedral to tetrahedral
positions in the lattice exists. In fact, the volume expansion due to hydrogen absorption shows that, when H/Pd ∼0.8,
the rate �V/V changes pointing towards a different occupation of hydrogen in the lattice.

Evidence for a structural and electronic phase transition, we will call it β → β′ in the next, is also provided
by measuring the number of charge carriers in the Pd–H system [5] which undergoes an unexpected change when
H/Pd≥0.83. It has been found that each hydrogen entering the Pd lattice in the b-phase contributes with about 0.75
electrons to the conduction band, whereas for x =H/Pd exceeding a threshold each hydrogen contributes with more
than four electrons to the conduction band; since the hydrogen has only one electron on its own it must persuade more
than three Pd electrons to jump into the higher energy band, so that the hydrogen that enters the lattice causes a local
reshufﬂing of the Pd electronic bands.

The electrical resistivity ρ(x) of the Pd–H system as a function of x shows an increase of the carrier and/or mobility
over a certain threshold [6] too. In the coexistent α−β region, ρ(x) increases almost linearly with the hydrogen content
up to the value where the β − β′ transition occurs: then it decreases quite sharply reaching the value ρ0 of the pure Pd
metal.

between two Pd atoms; the tetrahedral sites are positioned on a different plane at a relative distance of 2.828 Å.


2. Hydrogen Kinetics in Palladium

In spite of such a puzzling picture, the understanding of hydrogen dynamics inside the solid state lattice is a very
important task both for theoretical physical chemistry, for applications in the ﬁelds of hydrogen fuel cycle and for
LENR researches. As mentioned above, the most interesting state of the Pd/H system starts at a speciﬁc loading
threshold which is not easy to obtain. During the isothermal loading process, the solute gradient inside the metal suffers
from a thermodynamic force inﬂuenced by all the ﬁelds that can affect the free energy of the solute.

The diffusion ﬂux is described by the general equation:

J = −M · c · grad µ,

where c is the hydrogen concentration, M the mobility related to D, the diffusion coefﬁcient, by the Einstein relation and
µ is the chemical potential. The stress induced by the hydrogen diffusive ﬂux causes an inhomogeneous distribution of
the solute. Kandasamy [7] showed that a suitable strain can stop the diffusion of hydrogen caused by the concentration
gradient, in fact the previous equation is modiﬁed as follows:

J = −D
�
∇c − c ¯V
RT ∇σ
�

where ¯V is the molar volume of hydrogen in the metal and σ the stress ﬁeld.

It is well known that during the loading expanded β areas grow near the α areas. In this region of coexistence very
strong deformation ﬁelds are generated at the border between the two phases, due to the different lattice parameters. This
process is highly irreversible because of the energy dissipation involved in the generation of dislocations. Calculations
performed for a cylindrical Pd cathode show that the maximum shear stress is obtained on the surface at the beginning
of the diffusion process. This means that the loading is abruptly limited to a thin slab underneath the surface, as a
consequence, the loading path is very important to determine the ﬁnal concentration proﬁle inside the metal [8].

The coexistence phase allows the strain gradient to grow and introduces into the system a stress energy which can
prevent any further intake of hydrogen, however, an appropriate path on p–c–T diagram can skip the coexistence region
and improve the loading [9]. In Fig. 2, it is shown the comparison between two loading procedures: (a) electrolysis of
LiOH solution using Pd wire; (b) the Pd wire has been pre loaded at high (>34 bar) pressure and (>270◦C) temperature
and then used as a cathode in LiOH electrolysis with the same parameters as in the former case. Above the point
P =34 bar and T =270◦C which is the critical point on the p–c–T diagram, the co-existence phase does not exist
anymore. The results clearly show that the loading ratio is 20% higher than usual.

A further increase of the concentration can be reached if the stress is allowed to relax with suitable loading procedure
both in gas phase and in electrolysis [10]. Figure 3 shows that switching the current level between two values improves
the loading ratio because the stress ﬁeld is allowed to relax during the low-current phase.

The experimental data show that the self-induced strain ﬁeld arising from very steep concentration gradients is
responsible for the well-known difﬁculty in obtaining reproducible high loading samples. In addition, possible damages
induced by the loading process itself can modify the material during the experiment in an unpredictable way, resulting
in poor reproducibility of the loading procedure.


3. Inﬂuence of Microstructure on Loading

To facilitate the loading avoiding the growth of an excessive strain it can be useful to prepare a material with intrinsic
characteristics such as to minimize the gradients in the solute concentration. Since the hydrogen diffusion coefﬁcient
is orders of magnitude higher in the grain boundaries than in bulk, the diffusive process takes place in two steps: ﬁrstly,
hydrogen is included in the grain boundaries where the diffusivity is higher, in a second step it diffuses inside the grain.

Figure 2.Concentration behavior vs time.(a) Pd sheet charged in electrolysis, I =10 mA, (b) Pd sheet pre charged in H2 gas and then in electrolysis
with I =10 mA.

The grain boundaries act as a source of hydrogen for the bulk where the actual diffusive process takes place. Thus the
presence of a suitable network of grain boundaries enhances the kinetics and reduces the chemical potential gradient
increasing the loading on the whole. The same mechanism works on thin ﬁlms where the reduced dimensionality limits
the growth of high stress ﬁelds, and the strains accumulated inside the ﬁlm can be relaxed toward the substrate. The thin

Figure 3.A further increase of the concentration value is obtained that allows the lattice to relax the stored stress ﬁelds temporarily decreasing the
electrochemical action on the electrode surface: changing the electrolytic current between two values instead of using only the high level improves
the loading.

ﬁlm loading is complicated by the expansion of the lattice. In Pd, �l/l can reach 10%, under this condition the ﬁlms
loose their adhesion on the substrate and delamination occurs. In case several loading–unloading cycles are required
the situation is even more difﬁcult to be faced. Several “tricks” can be used to improve the adhesion to the substrate
choosing appropriate buffer layers made out of several different layers in order to absorb part of the mechanical stress
generated by the loading process.

Thermo-mechanical treatments and in particular cold working followed by baking can be used to modify the grain
size in Pd samples. Grain size dimension can be changed both with the mechanical machining and with the thermal
treatment, and it is possible, ﬁxing one parameter, to obtain curves as those in Fig. 4 which shows a maximum of the
loading ratio versus the grain size. Such a behavior implies that two different factors enhance the hydrogen diffusion
into the lattice: smaller grain size reduces the strength of the stress ﬁeld since the boundary network acts as fast hydrogen
transporter through the sample; on the other hand the softening of the mechanical properties induced by larger grain size
activates the stress relief mechanism based on plastic deformations. The combination of the two mechanisms enhances
both diffusivity through short circuit path and stress relaxation by plastic deformations. Concentrations larger than 0.95
H/Pd and 0.90 D/Pd have been obtained in electrolytic loading of samples with about 50 µm grain size [11].


4. PD/H Systems in H Plasmas

It is known that an electric ﬁeld causes the changes of Pd surface reactivity and, as a consequence, an increase of the
stoichiometry of Pd/H can be measured. Di Pascasio et al. [12] studied the possibility to increase the hydrogen loading
in a metallic material, Pd in particular, in presence of a hydrogen plasma. They found that the hydrogen conﬁnement in
Pd can be increased by exposing it to cold H plasma without changing any other parameter. The term “cold plasma” is
used for plasmas having a low concentration of ions (∼ 106m−3) in thermal equilibrium within the environment. Due
to the low concentration of electrons the heat transfer is controlled by the neutral species. They concluded that a new
thermodynamic condition is achieved in presence of a plasma, in particular, the thermodynamic condition of H inside

Figure 4.Loading ratio D/Pd vs. grain size. The two series refer to different values of reduction by cold rolling. Open circles: reduction
rate = 1/5; black diamonds: reduction rate = 1/7. The annealing temperature was 900◦C for both. Samples were loaded in electrolysis with a current
density i =25 mA/cm2.

Pd is affected by the presence of an external electric ﬁeld even if the material characteristics are still that of a metal.
Even Tomaszewska and Stepie [13] found that in presence of an external electric ﬁeld Pd–H bonds seem to become
stronger or, in a different view, the existence of an electric ﬁeld decreases the activation energy required for hydrogen
diffusion into the subsurface. More recently, an international team of researchers has developed a process using an
electric ﬁeld which can signiﬁcantly improve hydrogen storage and release in/from materials [14].

In these reports, they came to the conclusion that, in a cold plasma, hydrogen inside the Pd lattice undergoes a
transformation which affects the state, the number and the transport properties of both electrons and H ions.

A very interesting demonstration of external plasma effect on the loading of H in Pd can be observed inducing a
corona discharge between two plane electrodes like those usually operating in electrolysis. The working electrode, a Pd
coating 2 µm thick on a Si wafer, was grounded and a positive voltage was applied to the counter Pt bulk electrode. Both
electrodes had a planar geometry with a 25.35 mm area, the gap between the electrodes was 4 mm. At the beginning
of the experiment, the gap was ﬁlled with LiOH solution, the applied potential was kept well below the breakthrough
voltage and the ordinary H loading occurred. As soon as the loading reached the threshold of the β → β′ transition (see
above), the solution was removed, the change of the electronic density on the Pd–H surface increased the number of
secondary electrons involved and a negative corona discharge was formed. H+ ions were accelerated with a high kinetic
energy toward the working electrodes and impinged on Si trespassing the Pd coating. Removing the electrode from its
housing and observing the surface with an optical microscope, a grid made out of very peculiar scratches was observed
(Fig. 5a). The strange morphology of the scratches is quite hard to understand because it is perhaps the heritage of
the polishing procedure of the Si wafer from which the electrode substrate was obtained. The same experiment carried
out using a deposition of Pd on Vycor glass shows pits randomly distributed (Fig. 5b). A possible explanation is that
tiny defects on the surface, although non visible before the discharge, have been ampliﬁed by the presence of the very
high gradients of the electric ﬁeld around the pins which, in turn, accelerate the ions within the limit of the plasma
area. Inside the area delimited by two parallel scratches a very high temperature was reached by the Si (Fig. 5c) which
appeared to be fused and resolidiﬁed. Cubic shapes with a pipe in the middle suggesting a re-crystallization process
from the fused state can be seen (Fig. 5d) using the SEM analysis. The accelerated H+ ions knocks with a very high
energy on the surface producing very deep damages. Proﬁlometry shows scratches as deep as 5 µm at the border of the
structures shown in Fig. 5.

Besides the visual inspection of the sample, the Pd on Si cathodes were subjected to Rutherford Backscattering
Spectroscopy (RBS) used for compositional thin ﬁlm analysis (less than 1 µm) and to Elastic Recoil DetectionAnalysis
(ERDA) which is an efﬁcient technique for high resolution depth proﬁling of light elements, especially for detection
of hydrogen depth proﬁle. In Fig. 6 (a–c) the RBS analysis results are shown compared to simulations in order to get
a quantitative evaluation. Figure 6a shows the comparison between a reference (not used in the experiment) sample of
Pd on Si and the behavior expected for a 9000 Å thick Pd ﬁlm; this is just to calibrate the instrument, 9000 Å is the bulk
limit for the instrument. Figure 6b shows that, after the experiment described above, the Pd ﬁlm was almost completely
removed from the Si surface: the analysis ﬁts the result obtained simulating a 40 Å thick ﬁlm made out of a mixture
of the metals used in the experimental set up; a bigger amount of Pd, about 300 Å thick ﬁlm, was found on the back
side of the Si wafer that was 1mm thick (see Fig. 6c). ERDA analysis, in Fig. 6d, shows the hydrogen content in a
6000 Å depth (the analyzed depth depends on the energy of the beam): signal below channel 200 accounts for the H2
content in a 6000 Å layer beneath the surface whereas the peaks around channel 200 show the hydrogen adsorbed on
the surface. An amount of hydrogen four times greater than in the reference was found on the surface exposed to the
plasma, however, a much higher value was found on the backside surface. The small amount of hydrogen found inside
the sample after the discharge can be ascribed to the very high reactivity of H+ ions which react with other species and
are subtracted to the analysis.

(c) and (d) SEM images of the sample shown in (a) with different magniﬁcations.


5. A Conceptual Discontinuity

Another surprising feature of the PdH system is the very high diffusion coefﬁcient (about 10−7cm2s−1 for hydrogen
in the a-phase) and the fact that the diffusion coefﬁcients for deuterium, hydrogen and tritium are in the order DD+ >
DH+ > DT+ different from what can be expected on the basis of a simple classical model of diffusion. Moreover,
Dandapani and Fleischmann [15] reported a very high equilibrium H/D separation factor for H and D dissolution
into Pd cathodes at high negative over potentials. They interpreted this fact in a way that the species behave like
classical oscillators in the lattice, in other words, they are virtually unbounded. Since the delocalization depends on
the occupancy by the protons of highly excited states, the above stated properties of deuterons inside Pd lattice: high
diffusion coefﬁcient, inverse isotopic effect, large oscillation in the lattice, implies that many-body interactions must
come into play and supply the energy required to raise the H+ to such excited states.

Even the analysis of the Born–Haber cycle for H in Pd requires some hypothesis “ad hoc”.

The rational chemical design of high-efﬁciency hydrogen Storage Metals (HSM) has to take into account the large
difference between H+ and H− ions :

(a)
H−1 → H0 + e−
(�H ◦ = +0.75 eV),

(b)
H+1 + e− → H0
(�H ◦ = −13.60 eV),

(c)
H0 → H2
(�H ◦ = −4.52 eV),

(d)
H−1 + H+1 → H2
(�H ◦ = −17.37 eV).

Figure 6.
(a) RBS of Pd on Si compared with a simulation of 9000 Å thick slab of Pd; (b) RBS of the cathode exposed to negative corona discharge
compared with a simulation of 40 Å of Pd–Pt-Ni Si on 20 000 Å of Si; (c) same as above but on back side of the sample compared with a simulation
of 300 Å of Pd–Pt-Ni Si on 20 000 Å; (d) ERDA measures the hydrogen content in a 6000 Å depth. The peak shows the hydrogen content inside (on
the left) and outside (on the right) the sample. See further details in the text.

Thus it is very important to state which is the real state of hydrogen inside the lattice, i.e. if it is in form of H2, H+
or H−. In 1929 Alfred Cöhn showed in an experiment on electromigration that hydrogen diffuses like a positive charge
when it enters the Pd lattice. This result was conﬁrmed by other authors [16,17] and the positive fractional charge was
measured to be in the range of 0.3–0.7. Even modeling the electronic structure [18] conﬁrms that the H drift appears to
involve partially positive charged ions. Moreover, the same calculations show that, increasing the loading, H hopping
through tetrahedral sites is energetically more promoted than through octahedral sites. The latter items may be just
another sign of the β → β′ transitions.

In order to behave like a (partially) positive ion inside the Pd lattice the hydrogen atom (or molecule) must ﬁnd very
strong electric ﬁelds in order to maintain itself in the ionized state (or to dissociate into two ions). The electric ﬁeld
inside the lattice must be able to produce a very high energy (13.6 eV over a distance of the Bohr radius 0.57 Å).

Clearly this requires a very peculiar electron distribution !

In a paper of 1994 [19], M. Fleischmann, S. Pons and G. Preparata wrote: “The hydrogen in the Palladium lattice is
present as protons and the second surprising feature is that the extremely dense proton plasma is present in an electron
concentration of 600–1000 M . . . we are driven to the conclusion that a satisfactory explanation of the stable existence
of the dense plasma must be based on an appropriate many-body model”. They centered their statement on the analysis
of the peculiarity in the Pd–H system described above.

As conclusion, Pd hydride behaves like a solid plasma inside a lattice. Such a perspective allows to explain the
inﬂuence of an external electric ﬁeld on hydrogen dynamics inside the Pd from a different point of view.

The chemical potential of hydrogen dissolved in Pd, in the α-phase can be set equal to

µH = µ0
H + RT ln
�
x
1 − x
�
+ �µH,
where µ0

H is the standard chemical potential, x = H/Pd, the second term is the conﬁgurational term for the ideal
statistic standard distribution among octahedral sites and the last one stands for the excess potential. At equilibrium the
chemical potential of hydrogen in gas equals the chemical potential of hydrogen inside the lattice

µH = 1
2µH2 + 1
2RT · ln pH2

and, introducing the Sievert constant K = exp
��
µ0
H − 1
2µ0
H2
�
/RT
�
one obtains
ln(pH2) = ln
�
K ·
x
1 − x
RT (�µH+ + �µe).

The term �µe represents the excess potential contribution of both protons and H− electrons. It is straightforward to
see that when the last term is omitted the equation represents the behavior in ideal solution state. This is actually
true in the α-phase x < 0.02 where hydrogen is an ideal solid solution in the host lattice. Increasing the hydrogen
concentration the elastic contribution �µH+ generates a distortion in the octahedral cage which, in turn, introduces an
attractive interaction between H-atoms and leads to the formation of clusters of high H density, namely the β-phase.
From this point on, in case the rigid band model is assumed, the electronic contribution to the excess potential is due
to the steep increase of the Fermi level caused by the electrons of the dissolved hydrogen, thus the loading is very hard
to be increased.

The experimental ﬁndings listed above point toward the growth of a new phase at x = xβ′ (namely the β’) where
protons occupy the tetrahedral sites and become tentatively unbound. In this phase the second (conﬁgurational) term
in Eq. (1) does not hold any more.

In case a potential V is applied to the metal, the excess potential �µe will include its effect according to [20]
�µ : |e|z∗V.

In case the metal has a negative potential, the chemical potential of hydrogen inside the lattice fall below the chemical
potential µext of the hydrogen outside. The proﬁle of the chemical potential µ is thus lowered by: (a) the phase transition
and (b) the �µe due to the voltage difference between inside and outside the metal. A new equilibrium point will be
reached at x′ = xeq + δx, where the ﬁrst term is related to the phase transition and the latter to the applied potential
according to (2). Consequently, if we apply a negative potential to the Pd/H system when the system is in the new phase
β′ at x ≡ xβ′ a current ﬂow j′ adds up to the electrolytic current jel:

j(x) = jel(x) + j′(x) = jel
�
1 + µ(xβ′) − µ(x)
µ(x′) − µ(xβ′)
�

which disappears when x ≡ xβ′. It is worthwhile observing that the transverse ﬁeld effect described above is not the
longitudinal electric ﬁeld generated by a voltage drop across the cathode accountable for electromigration.

A quantitative analysis of this effect can be obtained measuring the R/R0 behavior during the LiOD electrolysis on
a Pd strip, 1ìm thick sputtered on Vycor glass (see Fig. 7). The deposition was shaped in such a way to have a high
electric resistance (about 1.5 k�) so that the voltage drop across the cathode was maximized and the longitudinal current
along the strip was limited. According to the well-known Baranowski relationship between the PdH(D) resistivity and
the loading ratio it can be seen that the loading increases (the resistance decreases above R/R0 ∼ 1.8) whenever the
voltage across the cathode increases.

In case the resistance of the cathode is not negligible (a strip, a wire, a patterned deposition) the electrostatic equation
for the cell has the following solution:
V (z) =
Vac
cosh(ξL) cosh[ξ(L − z)],
where z is the curvilinear coordinate, Vac is the voltage drop between anode and cathode, L is the total length of the
cathode and
ξ2 = ρc
ρel
δd F.

Figure 7.Normalized resistance of a Pd deposition on Alumina substrate in LiOD electrolysis.

F is a factor accounting for the cell geometry, δ the cathode thickness and d its width, ρc and ρel the electrical resistivity
of the cathode and the cell.

This potential acts as a source of the additional current ﬂux which is not uniform across the sample but depends on
the distance of the point where the voltage Vac is applied. The result is an inhomogeneous loading along the sample.


6. PD–H(D) System and Low-energy Nuclear Reactions

The above analysis of PdH(D) systems pictures a quite peculiar system looking like a solid plasma. This may answer the
thoughtful question about the reality of Low-Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) in condensed matter. Such a question
is usually asked in the context of Quantum Mechanics which shows that “Cold Fusion” should not be possible: nuclear
physics of deuterons in the lattice (with a space–time scale six orders of magnitude smaller than the space–time scales
of the lattice) should not differ from nuclear physics in vacuum. However since 1989 several scientists posed the
problem in the framework of Quantum Electro Dynamics (QED). Preparata et al. [21] observed that the ground state
in condensed matter involves the atoms/molecules of a macroscopic piece of matter in an intricate dynamical interplay
mediated by large amplitude (classical) e.m. ﬁelds. This intuition was substantially shared by Julian Swinger [22],
one of the fathers of QED: deuterons inside the Pd lattice can be described as a plasma in condensed matter having a
strong electromagnetic coupling with the lattice. In such a picture LENR appear as a natural development of the very
ﬁrst concept of nuclear fusion.

The very ﬁrst nuclear fusion reaction used 100-kV powerful gas discharge developed by Mark Oliphant, heavy
water for the Deuterium was produced by Paul Harteck while the analysis of the cloud chamber was done by Lord
Rutherford [23]. First attempts to develop the reaction into an energy source were done by Oliphant in 1937 who tried
to produce extremely intense deuterium or deuterium–tritium beams from gas discharges, having an energy of about
100 keV, to hit targets containing deuterium or deuterium–tritium. These attempts were radically rejected by Spitzer
(1957) who argued that such beam experiments do well result in fusion reactions but it is absolutely impossible to
produce more energy by fusion than is put in for the beams. The Spitzer objection was that the ion energy goes mostly
into heating of the electrons in the target, never permitting an exothermal fusion reaction. Spitzer’s option led to the
decision that instead of bombarding a cold target, one has to heat the reacting particles as in the sun, up to the plasma
state at a temperature of dozens of million degrees so that ions do not lose their energy by collisions with electrons and
the desired fusion reactions can take place. Following Spitzer’s argument, the handling of the fusion plasma within the
magnetic conﬁnement is at a stage at which a test reactor ITER is going to be built by 2015, which may lead, hopefully,
to a power station to supply 4 GW fusion energy output by 2040.

Spitzer’s argument keeps its full validity as long as the beam-irradiated target remains at ordinary state of matter.

The basic concept of thermonuclear fusion is to produce extremely high temperature plasmas with a suitable density
in order to sustain the reaction.

But, what if a solid-state plasma can be naturally available in nature at room temperature!

If we study the dynamics of particles moving as a screened ion gas in condensed matter we must pay attention to
the boundary conditions due to the very complex disposition of the atoms and their electronic clouds in the equilibrium
positions of the lattice. The dynamics of deuterons in the Pd lattice is similar to the motion of charged particles stored in
a radiofrequency electric quadrupole trap subjected to the Mathieu’s equations. Pd electrons of the outer bands oscillate
around their equilibrium sites producing strong electric ﬁelds; due to the peculiar structure of the Pd lattice a radio
frequency trap is formed among Pd atoms in (101) and (101) planes. It can be shown [24] that the combined effect of
the trap force, electrostatic interaction, non linearity and damping produce, under proper conditions, the increase of the
collision probability between quasi-free deuterons. The initial conditions, i.e. the deuterons density, their velocity and
their initial coordinates determine the overall percentage of colliding particles. Thus experimental conditions able to
affect the dynamics of deuterons in a way that an external electric ﬁeld or a suitable deuteron ﬂux from side to side can
signiﬁcantly increase the collision rate. This may explain the different experimental approaches to the phenomenon
and the variety of experimental results in terms of nature and yield of nuclear products: (a) static approach means that
the material has a very high loading ratio, at which a signiﬁcant part of the lattice fulﬁlls the condition described by
Preparata et al. in [21]; (b) dynamical approach based on deuteron or D2 gas ﬂux through the Pd target.

Physical mechanisms responsible for the observed nuclear event have been proposed [25,26] but their discussion is
out of the scope within this paper. From the above description of PdH(D) systems three major considerations result:
(a) at high loading ratios a phase transition occurs so that hydrogen (or Deuteron) behave like almost unbound charged
particles; the strong coupling of these particles with the electromagnetic ﬁeld that exists inside the matter makes the
familiar picture of nuclear reactions in vacuum unsuited to describe the energy release typical of a localized nuclear
event; (b) hydrogen or Deuteron are in a quasi-plasma state and their dynamics inside the lattice is strongly inﬂuenced
not only by the local structure of the lattice but also by their kinetic conditions. This may explain why so many different
experimental approaches have been proposed so far to trigger LENR; (c) the energy resulting from a nuclear event is
shared among several components which implies the existence of high energy classic ﬁelds which can, in turn, induce
secondary nuclear reactions, such as transmutations.
