1 Introduction

Despite the enormous increase of work in the study of the PdHx system in the last few years, there has not
been (to our knowledge) a systematic study of heat capacity of the PdHx system at loading ratio in the range
0<x<0.93 at room temperature. The present work is addressed to the measurement of such a quantity. It is
possible to define a “molar” heat capacity PdH x
C as the ratio:

Total heat capacity moles of Pd PdHx C = (1.1) 

without entering in the subtle issues raised by this problem; the present work will be kept on an eminently
experimental ground.

Our measurement was made possible by the availability of a method for loading and keeping charged a thin
Pd wire for a long time [1-3]. The method relies on an electrolytic procedure (based on Sr and Hg deposition
on the Pd cathode) able to reach high loading ratio ([H]/[Pd] 1). The samples used are Pd wires 50 mm
diameter, 10 cm length Pd wire. The stability of the loading is guaranteed by the presence of a thin Hg layer
(typically a few mm) electrolytically deposited on the Pd wire surface. Depending on the Hg layer thickness
we are able to obtain a totally blocked or slowly deloading wire (<10% deloading in one day).

Due to the smallness of the sample, when measuring heat capacity we are faced with two main problems:

1. devising a reliable method for measuring wire temperature

2. avoiding large heat leakage from the sample.

We have solved these difficulties by measuring the time variation of the wire temperature due to step-wise
current pulses by monitoring the electric resistance.

Heat leakage from the sample due to the presence of air has been reduced by placing the wire sample inside a
vacuum chamber (pressure ~ 60 mTorr) and soldered to two vacuum-tight electrodes kept at ambient
temperature. We have verified that, in this pressure range, residual leakage is significantly reduced.
Heat capacity has been measured at several loading ratios. This has been accomplished by progressively
deloading a highly loaded Pd wire ( x ; 1), either by spontaneous deloading (especially at high loading
ratios) or by a suitable heating of the wire obtained by current pulses.


2 Temperature measurement

The loading ratio was estimated by measuring the electrical resistance of the wire [4].
The relation between resistance and temperature is

0

(2.1)

The measurement of the thermal coefficient of resistance ( )
T a x was performed at several loading ratios in
the range 0  x < 0.97 and on different wires by measuring the wire resistance (using a four wire method) at
three different temperatures (15°C, 25°C and 35°C) at fixed loading ratio. This was accomplished by placing
the wire in a sealed container into three different water heat baths. The obtained results are summarized in
Figure 1.

Data are consistent with available data in the literature [5, 6] and confirm the validity of equation (2.1) in the
range 0  x < 0.97 . It is worth noting that the presence of the Hg layer (~2mm), on the Pd surface, does not
alter significantly the measured resistance values since its resistivity (~10
-6 W m) is much larger than that of
Pd (~10
-7 W m) and the cross section ratio is ~6·10
-3
.

3 Physical model of the wire

The temperature distribution along the wire due to
Joule heating cannot be uniform because the wire
ends are kept at room temperature. Therefore it is
necessary to develop a physical model that
accounts for spatial dependence of the wire
temperature. The model is based on the following
assumptions:

- the wire is homogenously loaded with
hydrogen,

- the radial temperature gradient on the wire is
negligible.

These assumptions lead to the following partial
differential equation (see [7]):

LK x t C x t G R I T x t R I G T x t           (3.1)

where T (x, t) is the wire temperature at position x at time t,
T
K is the longitudinal thermal conductivity of
the PdHx wire, GT
is the transverse thermal convection coefficient, I is the current across the wire,
amb
T is
the ambient temperature, L is the wire length and T
C is the total heat capacity of the wire. Please note that
the radiative contribution to the dissipation power is neglected due to its smallness with respect to the
convection term.

Being the heat capacity of the connectors holding the Pd wire much larger than CT
, we are allowed to fix the
spatial boundary conditions of the problem as
,

. (3.2)

Besides, the initial condition is given by the steady state of the wire traversed by a constant current
0
I present
prior to the pulse i.e. the stationary solution of (3.1) for
0
I I 

. The solution of the analytical problem is
addressed in [7] where T (x,t) is calculated. Then the wire resistance R(t) as a function of time (the actual
physical measured quantity) is given by the spatial integral: 

( ) 0 2 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 ( ) (1 ( , )) 1 exp 1 2 1 L n T n n n n T I L n T n R R t R t T x t dx R L C L n                  Î Ë Û Þ Ï Ì Ü ß Ð Í Ý à × Ê (3.3) 

where 0 RI is the steady-state wire resistance when a current 0 I is passing through the wire,

and 0 0 and n n   are obtained by the substitution 0 I  I in (3.4).

It is possible to show that to a good approximation only the first two terms in the sum of eq. (3.3) give a
significant contribution in our experimental conditions.


4 Experimental setup

The experiment consists in a wire suspended inside a vacuum chamber and connected through vacuum-tight
connectors to a current generator (ELIND
500KL2,4/6). Three digital multimeter
(Keithley2000) measure the voltage across the wire,
the current through the wire and the ambient
temperature by means of a Pt100 thermoresistance.
A computer at a rate of 5-10 samples/second
continuously acquires data. The PC also controls the
current generator via GPIB and stores the data on a
file for further elaboration. The vacuum chamber is
continuously evacuated by a rotative pump and it is
maintained at a constant pressure of ~60 mTorr.
This procedure is necessary in order to reduce heat
leakage through the surface of the wire that would
otherwise considerably reduce the accuracy in the
estimation of CT
. Secondly the time constant of the
system is also increased to a suitable level for the
available sampling rate.

5 Results

The best estimation of CT
has been computed as the weighted average over about 10 different current steps.

Please note that the loading ratio was not affected by the current steps used in the measurement since
restoring the current to the initial value the resistance returned to the initial value.

The only unknown parameters in our system (eq. (3.1)) are , CT KT
and GT
and have been estimated
numerically by fitting the data with the least squares method.

The actual function used in the fitting procedure is the simplified expression for the wire resistance as a
function of time given by the first two terms of the sum in equation (3.3), whose analytical expression is

where

R is the wire resistance before the current pulse while the coefficients 1 2 1 A , A , ! and 2 "
have a well

.

The goodness of the measurement and, in particular, the validity of the assumptions at the basis of the
theoretical model, have been tested by measuring the heat capacity of pure Pd and Pt wires in the same
conditions. The values found are consistent with the well-known published data
3
.

The value of CT
obtained by fitting the data is not the heat capacity of the PdHx but rather the total wire heat
capacity and is the sum of two contributions:

x
CT CPdH CHg
= + (5.2)

where
x
CPdH
is the heat capacity of PdHx system and CHg
the heat capacity of the Hg surface layer. Two
different methods have been used for the estimation of CHg
:

1. evaluation of the quantity of Hg deposited on the wire by measuring directly the Hg thickness by
means of SEM images;

2. comparison of the CT
value of PdHx=0 sample covered with Hg layer with the CT
value of a pure Pd
wire.

The two methods give consistent results within the accuracy of the overall measurement
4
. In order to avoid
the trivial dependence of
x
CPdH
from the size of the sample, we have defined a specific heat capacity:

where Pd
n is the number of Pd moles in the sample.

In Figure 2 are represented the measured C(x) of three different wires


6 Conclusions

The striking feature of Figure 2 is the rapid variation of C(x) around x ; 0.7 . Such a behavior of the heat
capacity suggests the existence of a phase transition. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that a
similar trend is shared by other physical quantities like the thermal coefficient of resistance aT
(measured in
the present work, Figure 1), resistivity [4, 6], superconducting behavior [8], Hall coefficient [9], diffusion
coefficient [10] and volumetric dilatation coefficient [11]. Moreover, the existence of such a phase transition
has been recently predicted by a theoretical model [12, 13].

As a final remark, as previously observed, also KT
and GT
are determined by the fit. Although KT would be
a significant quantity, characteristic of the PdHx system, unfortunately its determination is affected by very
large error bars. Lastly, the parameter GT
is not relevant because it is not an intrinsic characteristic of the
PdHx system. In facts it depends on residual pressure and on geometrical configuration of the experimental
setup.
