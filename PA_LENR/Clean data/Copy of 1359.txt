1. Introduction

In this model of lattice takes place within the Coherence Theory of Condensed Matter and represents a general theoretical
framework accepted from most of scientists that work on cold fusion phenomena. In the coherence theory of condensed
matter [5], it is assumed that the electromagnetic (e.m.) field due to elementary constituents of matter (i.e. ions and
electrons) plays a very important role on system dynamics. In fact considering the coupling between (e.m.) equations,
due to charged matter, and the Scrödinger equation of field matter operator, it is possible demonstrate that in proximity
of e.m. frequency, ω0, the matter system shows a coherence dynamics. For this reason, it is possible to speak about
coherence domains whose length is about λCD = 2π/ω0. Of course, the simplest model of matter with coherence domain
is the plasma system. In the usual plasma theory, we must consider the plasma frequency ωp and the Debey length that
measures the Coulomb force extension, i.e. the coherence domain length. For a system with N charge Q of m mass
within a volume, V , the plasma frequency can be written as

ωp = Q √m N V , (1)

ωp ≈ 10 eV/h. ¯

In this work, we study the “nuclear environment” that it is supposed existent within the palladium lattice D2-loaded and
at room temperature as predicted by Coherence Theory. In fact when the palladium lattice is loaded with deuterium gas,
some peoples declared that it is possible observe traces of nuclear reactions [1–3]. For this reason, many physicist speak
about Low-energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR). The more robust experiments tell us that in the D2-loaded palladium case
the nuclear reactions more frequent are [3,4]:

D+D → 3H+p+4.03 MeV, D + D → 4He + 23.85 MeV. (2)

Thus, an experimental analysis of this phenomenon requires neutron, proton and gamma rays detectors. A brief list
follows of detectors that are most frequently quoted in the literature. Further (n = neutron, p = proton, in parenthesis the
probabilities of the three final branches). The first step in the reaction is the creation of a 4He nucleus with an excess
energy of 24 MeV.

This reaction has been extensively studied, mostly, through experiments performed with the help of particle accelerators, which means in quasi-vacuum and with energetic particles (>105 eV). This is quite different from the CF
experiments, which take place in condensed matter at room temperature (energies of the order of a small fraction of an
eV).

In this work, we also propose a ‘coherence’ model by means of which we can explain the occurrence of nuclear
reactions and their probability according to the more reliable experiments. First, we will start from the analyze of
environment, i.e., of plasmas present within palladium (d-electron, s-electron, Pd-ions and D-ions) using the coherence
theory of matter; finally, we will use the effective potential reported in [7,8] adding the role of lattice perturbations by
means of which we compute the d–d tunneling probability.


2. The Plasmas Present within No Loaded Palladium

According to Coherence Theory of Condensed Matter, in a Pd crystal at room temperature the electron shells are in
a coherent regime within coherent domain. In fact, they oscillate in tune with a coherent e.m. field trapped in the
coherent domains. For this reason, in order to describe the lattice environment, we must take into account the plasma
of s-electron and d-electron.

2.1. The plasma of the d-electrons:
They are formed by electrons of palladium d-shell. We can start computing:

ωd = e √m ndN V (3)

as d-electrons plasma frequency. As already seen in the chapter about plasmas, this value must be increased by a 1.38
factor in the case of a real plasma, due to distribution of neutralizing charges (Pd ions, in this case).

\We can understand this correction observing that formula (??) is obtained assuming a uniform d-electron charge
distribution. But of course the d-electron plasma is localized in a shell of radius R (that is about 1 Å), so the geometrical
contribution is

 6 π R = 1.38. (4)

Labeled with ωde the renormalized d-electron plasma frequency, we have [5]: 

ωde = 41.5 eV/h¯ (5) 

and the maximum oscillation amplitude ξd is about 0.5 Å.

2.2. The plasma of delocalized s-electrons: 
The s-electrons are those which in the lattice neutralize the adsorbed deuterons ions. They are delocalized and their
plasma frequency depends on loading ratio (D/Pd percentage) by means of the following formula [5]: 

ωse = e √m N V  x λa , (6) 

where 

λa = 1 − N V Vpd (7) 

and Vpd is the volume effectively occupied by the Pd-atom. As reported in [5], we have 

ωse ≈ x1/215.2 eV/h. ¯ (8) 

For example for x = 0.5, we have ωse ∼ 10.7 eV/h¯. 

2.3. The plasma of Pd-ions: 
Finally, we must consider the plasma due to palladium ions that form the lattice structure. In this case, it is possible to 
demonstrate that the frequency is [5] 

ωpd = 0.1 eV/h. ¯ (9)


3. The Plasmas Present within D2-loaded Palladium

We know that the deuterium is adsorbed when is placed near to palladium surface. This loading can be enhanced using
electrolytic cells or vacuum chambers working at opportune pressure [9,10]. By means theory of Condensed Matter,
we are assumed that according to the ratio x = D/Pd, three phases concerning the D2–Pd system exist:

(1) phase α for x < 0.1,

(2) phase β for 0.1 <x< 0.7,

(3) phase γ for x > 0.7.

In the αtphase, the D2 is in a disordered and not coherent state (D2 is not charged!). Regarding the other phases, we
start remembering that on surface, due to lattice e.m., takes place the following ionization reaction:

Dlattice → D++ e−. (10)

Then, according to the loading percentage x = D/Pd, the ions deuterium can take place on the octahedrical sites or in
the tetrahedral in the (1,0,0)-plane. In the coherence theory it is called β-plasma the deuterons plasma in the octahedral
site and γ -plasma which in tetrahedral. Regarding to β-plasma it is possible affirms that the plasma frequency is given
by [5]:

ωβ = ωβ0(x + 0.05)1/2, (11)

where

ωβ0 = e √mD N V 1/2 1 λ1/2 a = 0.15 λ1/2 a eV/h. ¯ (12)

For example, if we use λa = 0.4 and x = 0.5 it is obtained ωβg 0.168 eV/h¯.

In the tetrahedral sites, the D+ can occupy the thin disk which encompass two sites.

They present to the D+ ions a barrier. Note that the electrons of the d-shell oscillate past the equilibrium distance
y0 (about 1.4 Å ) thus embedding the ions in a static cloud of negative charge (whose can screen the Coulomb barrier).
So, as reported in [5], we have

ωγ =  4Zeffα mDy2 0 ≈ 0.65 eV/h. ¯ (13)

Of course, this frequency depends also on chemical condition of palladium (impurities, temperature, etc.). Due to
a large plasma oscillation of d-electrons, in the disk-like tetrahedral region (where the γ -phase D+’s are located) a
high-density negative charge condenses giving rise to a screening potential W (t).
We emphasize that the γ -phase depends on x value and that this new phase has been experimentally observed [11].


4. The d–d Potential

In [7], it was shown that the phenomenon of fusion between many body, i.e. nuclei of deuterium in the lattice of a metal
is conditioned by the structural characteristics, by the dynamic conditions of the system, and also by the concentration
of impurities present in the metal under examination. In fact, studying the curves of the potential of interaction between
deuterons (including the deuteron–plasmon contribution) in this case typical metals Pd, a three-dimensional model
showed that the height of the Coulomb barrier decreases on varying the total energy and the concentration of impurities
present in the metal itself. The starting potential that links like-Morse attraction and like-Coulomb repulsion can be
written in this way [7,8]:

V (r) = k0 q2 r  V (r)M − A r  . (14)

In (??), V (r)M is a like-Morse potential and is given by:

V (r)M = D {exp ( − 2ϕ (r − r0)) 2 exp (−ϕ (r − r0))}, (15)

Here, the parameters A, ϕ and r0 depend on model. In fact the potential (??) is an effective potential whose reliability
is demonstrated from its ability to fit the Coulomb potential for r → 0 and the Morse potential in the attractive zone. In
this way, following Siclen and Jones [12] define ρ the point where the Coulomb potential is linked by Morse trend, r
0 the equilibrium distance and D the well. Of course, in the free space for a D2 molecular ρ is about 0.3 Å , r0 is about 0.7 Å and D is – 4.6 eV. But within the lattice the screening effect and the deuteron–deuteron interaction by means of
phonon exchange modify very much these parameter values.

Taking into account, the role of coupling between deuteron and plasmons, in [13] the authors have numerically
evaluated a d–d potential having the features of potential (??) with D = −50 eV and r
0 = 0.5 Å and ρ = 0.2 Å (in [13] the authors consider only two plasmon excitations at 7.5 and 26.5 eV).

Since the screening effect can be modulated by donor atoms, we have considered in [7,8] the role on impurities and
has been demonstrated that we can put:

A = JKTR (16)

and

B = J/ς. (17)

Here, J is the impurities concentration, KT the lattice temperature, R the nuclear radius and ζ a parameter to
evaluate by fitting.

Finally, we can write the effective d–d potential in this way:

V (r) = k0 q2 r  V (r)M − JKTR r  . (18)

In this work, according to coherence theory of condensed matter, we study the role of potential (??) in the three
different phases: α, β and γ . Whereas regarding the second point, the question is more complicate. In fact, the lattice
environment is a mixing of coherent plasmas (ion Pd, electron and deuterons plasma) at different temperature, due to
different masses, thus describing a emerging potential is very hard office. The method that in this work we propose
is the following: considering the total screening contribution of lattice environment at d–d interaction (i.e. Vtot) as
random potential Q(t). So in this model we can write

Vtot(t) = V (r) + Q(t). (19)

Of course, we assume that:

Q(t)t 	= 0 (20)

that is, we suppose that Q(t)(a second-order potential contribution) is a periodic potential (the frequency will be labeled
by ωQ) that oscillates between the maximum value Qmax and 0. More exactly, the charge oscillations of d-shell produce
a screening potential having an harmonic features:

eV(r) = −Zd ke2 2a0 r2. (21)

In [5], putting Zd = 10/3 and a0 = 0.7 Å, it is evaluated a screening potential V0 of about 85 eV. In this way, we can
compute ρg V0/26.9 and at last ρ = 0.165 Å.

To summarize, we can have the following cases in a palladium lattice according to loading ratio.

4.1. α-Phase:
In phase αsghe deuterons are in a molecular state and the thermal motion is about:

0.02 eV < hω¯ α < 0.1 eV.

This phase takes places when x is less than 0.1, and since W (t) is zero, the d–d potential is

V (r) = k q2 r  VM(r) − J hω¯ α R r  . (22)

Expression (??) has been partially evaluated in a previous paper [7] but in that case we was interesting only to the
dependence of tunneling probability on impurities present within lattice. In this work, we examine the correlation
between potential features and loading ratio. In the paragraph 5 we will show some numerical results.

4.2. β-Phase:
When x is bigger than 0.1 but less than 0.7, the phase β happens. The interaction takes place between deuteron ions
that oscillate by following energy values:

0.1 eV < hω¯ β < 0.2 eV.

In this case, W (t) is zero, so the potential is given expression (??):

V (r) = k q2 r  VM(r) J hω¯ β R r  . (23)

Comparing expressions (??) and (??) seems very clear that the weight of impurities is more important in the β-phase.
Of course, this conclusion is in according to the previous papers [7,8], where we studied the role of temperature on
tunneling effect.

4.3. γ -Phase:
Finally, when the loading ratio is higher than 0.7, the deuteron–palladium system is in the phase γ .

This is the more interesting case. The deuterons undergo the screening due to d-electrons shell, so we suppose
that the d–d potential must be computed assuming that the well present in potential 14, due to Morse contribution,
disappears. In fact if we use a classical plasma model where are the D+ ions the positive charge and the d-electrons the
negative, it is very reasonable suppose that we must use the following potential:

V (r, t) = k q2 r  VM(r) J hω¯ γ R r  + Q(t). (24)

We emphasize that Q(t) is a not known perturbative potential. About it we can only say that:

Q(t)t ≈ Wmax√2 . (25)

As said previously, we suppose that it is the screening potential due to d-electrons and its role is that to reduce the
repulsive barrier, i.e. ρ and r0.

In next evaluation, we put

Q(t)t ≈ 85 eV. (26)


5. Results and Discussions

Now we present the d–d fusion probability normalized to number of events per second regarding the d–d interaction in all
different phase. More exactly we compare the fusion probability in the phases α, β and γ at varying of energy between
–50 and 50 eV. We also consider the role of d-electrons screening as perturbative lattice potential. This treatment, which
interests only the case where Q(t) is different from zero, involves that we change the value of point on the x-axes where
the Coulomb barrier takes place and, in this case, the final result is that the screening enhances the fusion probability.
In order to evaluate the fusion rate (), we applied this formula:

 = A. (27)

In this case, the Morse potential will be

V (r)M = D exp (−2 ϕ (r − r0)) 2 exp (ϕ (r − r0)),

E1 = a few eV,

E2 = −D  1 − γ h¯ √2µ D  ν + 1 2 2 , 

E3 ∼  me MN  E1∼ 1 1000 eV, 

E4 = D

where γ is the constant of anharmonicity of the metal and ν is the vibrational constant. Another important quantity is
D, which is the depth of the potential well: D this is Morse potential

Now an energy tensor Eij can be built:

E11 = E1, E22 = E2, E33 = E3, E44 = E4, Eij = Ei − Ej , Eij = −Ej i.

Thus, a square quadratic energy value can be determined.

For this case, we assumed a Morse potential as the most realistic.

I ≈ e2πZaZX / 4πε0 h ν ¯

is the Gamow factor and A is the nuclear reaction constant obtained from measured cross sections (value used
was 1022 s−1).

Figure 1. Features of V (r) and V (r) + Wmax/√2.

The probability partial reaction that takes into account the factor penetration of the barrier, with  Gamow factor.
Furthermore, the potential can be considered adiabatic to a very good approximation. In fact, the adiabatic parameter
h(I/V (R))( ¯ dV(R)/dt) < 0.1 eV, which is much smaller than the plasmon energies (or other typical electron excitation
energy).

To have an estimate of the consequence of this result on the d–d fusion rate, let us model the deuterons inside
palladium as a classical gas interacting through the total conservative potential depicted in Fig. 1 (full line), at a
temperature T .

From the point of experimental view, in the cold fusion phenomenology, it is possible to affirm that there are three
typology of experiments [14]:

(1) those that have given negative results,

(2) those that have given some results (little detection signs with respect to background, fusion probability about
10−23 using a very high loading ratio

(3) those that have given clear positive results as Fleischmann and Pons experiments.

Nevertheless, we think that the experiment like 3-point are few accurate from a point of experimental view. For
this reason, we believe that a theoretical model of controversial phenomenon of cold fusion, must explain only the
experiments like points 1 and 2. In this case need consider the role of loading ratio on the experimental results. Now,
let us begin from α-phase. It is possible affirms that if we load the deuterium with a percentage x < 0.2 we do not
observe any fusion event! The same absence of nuclear phenomenon is compatible for a loading ratio of about 0.7.
Since in this case the predicted fusion probability is less than 10−42. These predictions, of course, are in agreement
to the experimental results. But for x > 0.7 a set of valid experiments on cold fusion report some background spikes
(e.g. see [6]). The remarkable result of our model is that in the γ -phase, as shown in Table 3, we can really observe
some background fluctuations, since we predict a fusion probability about 10−22 due to a very high loading ratio. This
represents a new result with respect to [7,8] since, in those cases, the fusion probability was independent on loading
ratio. To conclude we shown that the model proposed in this paper (which unify nuclear physics with condensed matter)
can explain some anomaly nuclear traces in the solids. Regarding the experiments at point 3 supposing that they could

Figure 2. xxx.

Figure 3. Interaction potentials in eV as a function of d–d distance R in Å

be real, we would invocate other contribution as micro-deformation occurrence in order to explain the very high fusion
rate. The role of micro-crack and of impurities linked by loading ratio will be explored in other speculative works. May
be the nuclear physics within condensed matter will be a new very productive scientific topic.
