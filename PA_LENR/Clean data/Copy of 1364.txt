1. Introduction

We focused our attention on the result of De Ninno
et al.[l] who observed neutron emission changing temperature of titanium in pressurized deuterium gas. Neutrons emerged from the titanium in a particular temperature of 240 K. This temperature seems to be corresponding to the phase-transition of titanium hydrides.
The change could make a cracks with a high electric
field between the gaps which accelerated deuterons.


So, we carried out the first experiment for searching neutrons from an electrolysis changing the temperature between 200 K and 300 K in order to create the
dynamic condition in palladium cathode. Additionally,
the advantage of the electrolysis at the low temperature
range is not only the capability of changing the temperature, but also increase of an absorbed amount of hydro
gen into palladium ( 2-4]. Furthermore, our detection
system was constructed in attention with a time interval
as wide range as possible, since we do not know how the
neutron emission occurs in the time structure.


2. Methods

2.1 Neutron detection system:
Neutron detection system was consisted of ten 3He
proportional gas counters (Reuter-Stokes, USA), which
were inserted in a paraffin moderator shaped as a cylinder with a height of 30 cm, outer and inner diameter of
38 cm and 10 cm, respectively. Each couple of the 3tte
counters was linked to a preamplifier. The pulse
height data were recorded using a CAMAC PHADC. The
event time was also stored to analyze the time structure
of the neutron emissions. The pulse height data can be
read out every 28.6 ms, which is limited by the CAMAC
readout time.

Detection efficiency of neutrons was defined as
number of detection per n�er of emitted in the cell
which was measured by the Cf neutron source placed at
the palladium electrode position. The detection efficiency was 3.3 % selecting within -3o-to +2o-. The
detection system was placed in Nkogiriyama underground
laboratory, Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, University of Tokyo, which was covered with sandstone of 100 m
water equivalent. The average of neutron background
rate was about 4/h.


2.2 Electrolysis:
The cell used in this work was made of quartz glass
of 22 mm in inner diameter and 150 mm in length. The
anode was a coiled shape made of a platinum wire of 0.5
mm in diameter and 500 mm in length. The palladium
cathode electrode of 5 mm in diameter and 20 mm length
was placed in the center of the platinum wire. We used
an electrolyte as 2N DC1(37 wt% with 99% D; Aldrich
Chemical Company, Inc.) of deuterated methanol (99.8
atom% D; ISOTEC Inc.) solution, whose freezing point was
lower than 200 K.

The electrolysis was continued unexchanging the
electrode but exchanging the electrolyte for about 2
weeks, because methanol was resolved into formaldehyde
and formic acid which froze under the low temperature
condition. The electrolysis was carried out with
constant current mode which was repeated between -113.2
mA/cm2 for 170 min. and -0.14 mA/cm2 for 10 min. The
total electrolysis duration was 1878 h, and the temperature of the electrolysis bath were kept at about 210 K.
The amount of absorbed deuterium was estimated by 
the measurements of thermogravimetory (TG) and temperature programed desorption (TPD) spectra of mass number
2. In our electrolysis condition, the average ratio of
deuterium was Pd:D=l:0.7.


3. Analysis and results

We studied the frequency distributions of the neutron count during the electrolysis of each time interval. The expected frequency distribution was deduced
from the Poisson distribution substituting the average
and the total counts of the time interval.

Searching from the time interval from 28.6 ms to 240
min, almost all the time interval frequency distributions were fit to the Poisson, but some anomalous events
were observed in 120 and 180 time intervals (Fig. 1).
They were one event of 22 counts/2h, which occurred at
31.01 days after the beginning of the electrolysis and
two events of 27 counts/3h at 62.14 and 82.17 days,
respectively. The pulse height distributions of the
three events were similar to that of the 252Cf source
data (e.g. fig. 2 shows the distribution of 22/2h
train). Thus the counts of these events can be decided
as the neutron signals. The neutron signals of these

events were distributed over the time duration (e.g.
fig. 3 shows the time distribution of 22/2h train).
This time distribution indicates that these emission
phenomena is not both a continuous process during the
electrolysis, and burst process.

tp:passage time, td:duration time, C:counts of neutron;
P:probability, m:sampling number, n:frequency of appearance, E:emission rate.

A statistical analysis of these three events were
summarized in table 1. The�e production rate of the 22
and 27 counts were 6.3xlo-24 and 4.5x10-2 /d-d/s during
2 and 3h, respectively. The confidence levels of
neutron emission for 22/2h and 27/3h were 88% and 59%,
iespectively. For the total of the three trains, the
canfidence level became 98%.

Since the anomalous neutron emission intermittently
occurs and continued a few hours, we will consider that
the possible process of the neutron emission phenomena
maybe related to the accumulation of stress and the
creep mechanism of cathode material.

We would like to express our appreciation to Prof.
K.Yamakoshi of The University of Tokyo to a facilities
for a usage of the Nokogiriyama underground laboratory.
