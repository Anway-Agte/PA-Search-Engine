1. Introduction

The "heat after death" phenomenon [1] has revealed a fact that the electrolysis is not necessary for
"excess heat" phenomena. Provided that enough deuterons are absorbed in the palladium crystal
lattice, we may expect to see the "excess heat" in a gas-loading system as well. We are particularly
interested in the gas-loading system, because we have been engaged in the gas-loading system for
several years[2-7]. Early in 1993, Manduchi et al. [8] showed that the palladium samples might be
soldered together during the gas-loading process with the deuterium gas. It was explained as an
evidence of"excess heat" in this gas loading system. Manduchi's experiments worked out with both
the Russian palladium and the British palladium samples. It seems that the only important pretreatment in his experiment is the annealing at the high temperature (900 °C} in vacuum. This is
consistent with the early basic research on the gas loading experiments. Oats and Flanagan [9] did
the gas loading experiments early in 1971. They showed that the only pre-treatment was just the
flame heating before use. The loading ratio was as high as 0.94 in their experiments as a matter of
routine. The even surprising point was that the gas-loading was done at low hydrogen pressure (1.5
Torr, 25 °C}. The key element was a heated tungsten wire which dissociated the hydrogen
molecules into hydrogen atoms. These features of operating under the low pressure and heating by
a tungsten wire facilitate the combination of a calorimetric system with a gas-loading system.

with palladium wire winding are made for Di-loading
and Hi-loading, respectively. They are put into a
electrical oven to be heated to 900 °C in vacuum
(10-3 Pa). Then they are cooled gradually with the

pump is used to pump out the air to 7 x 10-4 Pa. 


3. Calorimetric Feature.

This stainless dewar vessel is
different from the glass or
quartz dewar electrolytic cell
in Fleischmann and Pons
experiments. In stead of
radiation, 
the 
heat 
con­
duction plays the dominant
role in the heat transfer.
Fig.2 shows the temperature,
0 , in the dewar as a func­tion of time.

approaches a constant value 01 
Here, k is the heat conduction coefficient in the Newton's Law of heat transfer. 0b 
is the room
temperature. The relaxation time of this system is determined by the reduced heat conduction
coefficient:

Here, 0 0 is the initial temperature of the dewar system at time to. This is the straight line section
shown in Fig.2. The slope of the straight line gives the value of the reduced heat conduction
coefficient, k ; the constant ( 0 b + S) may include the information for both the applied heat source,
k 
P; and the internal heat sources, Q. The applied heat source, P, is the heating power given by the
experimentalist; however, the internal heat sources, Q, may include the "excess heat" which is what
we are searching for.

There are two ways to determine:

( 1) Heating method: Given a constant heating power ( e.g. a constant current through the tungsten
wire), the temperature, 0, approaches a constant value, 

(2) Cooling method: When we plot the Fig.2 using the experimental data, we have to have a correct
value for 0 b + S in order to make a straight line for cooling part. Fig.2 shows that the least squares fit is able to find the value of 0b + S with a precision better than 3%. 0.5 °C change in 0b + S
may make the straight line visibly distorted (i.e; bent upward or downward, if the 0 b + S is not a
correct number.)
Fig.2 shows also the sensitivity of our calorimetric system. When a small power of2.73W is applied 
onto the calorimetric system through a current in the tungsten wire, the temperature goes up to a 
constant value of 96.0 °C. Then the current is shut off, and we see a straight line of cooling curve 
with no heat source (see equation (6) ). Later we turn on the current in the tungsten wire again with 
a power of 2.55W, a clear inflection point appears to stop the straight line, and levels to a new 
constant value. Particularly, the curve goes up continuously at a power of 2.1 W and turns 
horizontal at a power of 1.9W. Thus, we are confident that this system is able to detect the "excess 
heat" at the level of 1 W per c.c. palladium while we put 0.234 c.c. palladium wire into this 
calorimetric system. 


4. Temperature Difference between Twin Systems

A calibration is necessary to quantify the "excess heat";
however, if we are able to show that there are sharp
differences in the calorimetric feature between the H/Pd
and D/Pd twin systems; then, we may qualitatively
show the evidence of the "excess heat".

To load the hydrogen or deuterium gas into the palladium, electrolytic cell was supposed to be necessary to provide the enough "chemical 
potential"; otherwise, the high pressure and low temperature was supposed to be necessary. R.F. 
power, a piece of incandescent tungsten wire (2000 °C ), or D.C. discharge were found to be able 
to provide the hydrogen or deuterium atoms in stead of the electrolytic current. However, we found 
that even if the tungsten wire was turn-off, as long as the correct pre-treatment of the palladium 
wire was done, the loading ratio (H/Pd or D/Pd by atom number) might achieve 0.74 at a pressure 
much less than 1 atm. This is discussed in two associated papers [10] and [11]. Here, we just 
discuss the calorimetric feature of the gas-loading system. 

In order to detect the possible "excess heat" in a D/Pd system, we intentionally built a pair of twin 
systems. No. l bottle is for deuterium loading, and No.2 bottle is for hydrogen loading. These two 
systems have same dewar structure, and similar quartz frames. The palladium wires in both bottles 
are cut from same batch ( <p 0.34mm); and have been pre-treated with same procedures. The weight 
of palladium wires in two bottles are 2.846g. and 2.844g., respectively. The tungsten wires are cut 
from same batch ( <p 0.1 mm). The resistance of tungsten wire are 4.1 n (in D bottle), and 4.3Q (in H 
bottle) , respectively. After being pumped to 10"3Pa, the No. I bottle was filled with deuterium gas 
up to 660 mrnHg; and the No.2 bottle was filled with hydrogen gas up to 660 mrnHg also. Fig.3 
shows the cooling curves for bottles No. I and No.2. A straight line is drawn to fit the experimental 
data using the least squares fit. From this straight line, the reduced heat conduction 
coefficient, k D and k H , is calculated. To maximize the correlation coefficient R2, we may determine 
the value of ( 0 b + S ) for that straight line. Table 1 gives the corresponding values for the reduced 
heat conduction coefficients k D and k H 
; the constants ( 0 b + -) D and ( 0 b + -) H; and the 
correlation coefficients R; and R !-

Temperature Range 
Reduced Heat Conduction 

It is clearly shown that the reduced heat conduction coefficients are same for both bottles with the 
precision better than 5%. However, the constants, 0b + S, are different for D/Pd and H/Pd 
k systems. The difference between them increases, when the temperature range expands. Since the 
information of "excess heat" is included in this constant, 0 b + S , we investigated further by 
k another method: i.e. we heat the systems using the electrical current in the tungsten wire. Through 
the constant current at 0, 0.1965A, 0.359A, 0.464A, 0.601A, 0.753A and 0.801A; the D/Pd and 
H/Pd systems are heated to different temperatures. From these temperatures, we may have another 
estimate of the constant, 0b + -. Table 2 list the results of these heating experiments. The 
difference of 01 - l.j, = [ ( l.j, + !)-1.j,] gives the ! � p; Q

In the experiments, the tungsten wires in the D/Pd and H/Pd are connected in series such that the 
electrical current, 
I w is same in both tungsten wires. This heating power enhances the 
temperature, 0 , in both bottles, and eventually makes a steady state value, 01. We can measure 
the temperature difference at the steady state between the inside and the outside of the dewar, which should be equal to the constant S = p + Q . In this case, P is the heating power in 
Tungsten wire, Q is the possible "excess power", k is the heat conduction coefficient. It is interesting 
to notice that when the heating power increases, the temperature difference, 01 - � , in D/Pd system 
increases much faster than that in H/Pd system. This could be attributed to the possible "excess 
power" in the D/Pd system. In order to estimate this "excess power", we need the value for heat

conduction coefficient, k D • Since the reduced heat conduction coefficients, k D and k H for D/Pd
and H/Pd are almost same (see table 1). It is reasonable to assume that the heat conduction 
coefficients, k D and k H, are same also. Based on this assumption, the "excess power" in the D/Pd 
system is calculated. It may achieve up to 0.821 W (see the last column in table 2) while the heating 
power is about 3.5W. An additional evidence of this "excess power" in D/Pd system is the change 
of the resistance of the tungsten wire. Initially, the resistance of the tungsten wire in H/Pd system 
(4.46 Q) is a little higher than that ofD/Pd system(4.15 Q). When the heating power is increased to 
~ 3.5W, the resistance of the tungsten wire in H/Pd system (5.38 Q) becomes smaller than that of 
D/Pd system (5.47 Q). Using the resistance temperature coefficient aw= 4.8 x 10-3 K-1 for 
tungsten wire, we have the temperature for the tungsten wires in the H/Pd and D/Pd system, 73.5 
�C and 96.9 °C, respectively. The temperature in D/Pd system is much higher than that of H/Pd 
system . This is consistent with the former calculation of the "excess power" inside the D/Pd 
system. 


5 Concluding Remarks: 

While a pair of twin calorimetric systems are heated by the same amount of electrical power, the 
systems approach different temperatures at steady state. The D/Pd system is hotter than the H/Pd 
system. The temperature difference may achieve the value of 8.5 °C measured by the platinum 
thermometer. Since the cooling curves have shown the reduced heat conduction coefficients for 
both systems are same, this temperature difference means that there must be an "excess heat" 
source in the D/Pd system. 

We are using platinum resistance thermometers and the Keithley digital multi-meter to measure the 
temperature. The precision of the measurement is better than 0.1 °C. Hence, we are confident about 
the existence of this temperature difference. This is a qualitative proof of the "excess heat" in D/Pd 
system. 

To quantify this excess heat, we need two assumptions: First the heat conduction coefficient is 
assumed to be same for the twin systems; second, the excess heat in the H/Pd system is assumed to 
be zero. The first assumption is supported by the equality of k D = k H; and the second assumption
just makes a conservative estimate on "excess heat". If there is any "excess heat" in the H/Pd 
system also; then, the "excess heat" in D/Pd system should be greater than this estimate. It is at 
least at a level of 1 W per c.c. palladium. We have observed this excess heat for more than 5 
months. (from April, 20 to September 29, in 1996) in a D/Pd system with 2.846g. of palladium. It is 
about 103 e V for each palladium atom, which is very difficult to be attributed to any chemical 
resource. This gas-loading system has the advantage of being operated at a higher temperature 
which is essential to enhance the heat energy efficiency as an energy source.
