INTRODUCTION. 

We have previously reported results of electrolysis of palladium
cathodes with a H2SO4-D2O electrolyte (1-3). Further results have now been obtained
with improved calorimetry. In addition, mass spectrometry is now being used to compare
the chemical makeup of the Pd before and after electrolysis.


EXPERIMENT AL METHODS AND RESULTS.

Cold rolled Pd foil was used as the
cathode in an electrolyte containing 0.06 mol fraction H2SO4 and 0.94 D2O. A Pt foil
anode was used, and electrolysis was performed for 12 minutes on 4-24-89. A piece of the
same Pd foil which had not been electrolyzed and the electrolyzed Pd cathode were then
analyzed by microscopy to determine the surface topography (1). The same samples were
analyzed in Oct. 1996 with a secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS), using a 3 KV Ce
ion beam and a quadrapole mass analyzer. Pd was sputtered at a rate of about 1 angstrom
per second for 50 minutes.

Fig. 1 shows preliminary SIMS results. It should be noted that the mass numbers given in
the figure result from combination of Cs ions and the Pd isotopes indicated. The spectra in
Fig. la from the Pd foil control (unelectrolyzed) shows that the relative intensities of the
Pd isotopes are approximately in proportion to their natural abundances.However, Fig. 1 b
shows that the Pd isotope of mass 108 is more abundant than Pd 106 in the electrolyzed
foil., whereas the natural abundance of Pd 108 is 26.46% and that of Pd 106 is27.33%
(4).The difference in these two abundances decreases with increased depth into the
sample. After sputtering for 50 minutes to a depth of about 0.3 µm, these two isotopes
have the same abundance.

Two closed cells of 25 ml capacity were constructed. Both had Pt anodes, an electrolyte
with 0.06 mol fraction H2SO4 in D2O, and recombination catalyst suspended above the
electrolyte. One cell had a Pd foil ( 0.055 g) cathode, and the other had a Pt foil
cathode of similar mass. Each cell was placed in an identical insulated

container. The cells were connected in series, and electrolysis was performed 
at constant current density of about 0.25 A/sq. cm. The cell voltages were 
almost the same. The temperature of the air surrounding the cells inside the 
insulated containers and the ambient temperature were monitored. 

During the first 20 hours of electrolysis, there was no difference in heat 
output of the two cells. For most of the next 50 hours of electrolysis, the cell 
with the Pd cathode produced more heat ( as much as 0.3 watt more) than the 
Pt cathode cell. A typical result is given in Fig. 2.

the Pd deteriorated and a solid black substance accumulated at the bottom of 
the cell. The Pt cathode did not appear to change. 

After lying dormant for 75 days, electrolysis was again performed. In five 
consecutive experiments totaling 20 hours over a period of two weeks, the 
cell with the Pt cathode produced more heat (as much as 0.3 watt more) than 
the Pd cathode cell. 

These results suggest that a Pt cathode, under suitable conditions, can serve 
to catalyze excess heat, consistent with the work of Ohmori and Enyo(6 ). 

After electrolysis for about 90 hours, both a Pd and a Pt cathrode were cleaned 
ultrasonically in deionized water and studied with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) 
and an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Fig. 3 shows the electrolyzed parts of both 
cathodes. The width of each cathode is less than the original width due to sputtering which 
occurred during electrolysis. It was shown previously that Pd is inert in the sulfuric acid­
heavy water electrolyte ( 1 ), and it is likely that this is also true for Pt. The extent of this 
sputtering is greater on the Pd than on the Pt cathode. For example, the original square 
corners of the Pd cathode are now rounded, whereas the corners of the Pt cathode remain 
almost square. 

The arrow on each electrode indicates a place where the same, unexpected elements were 
found by EDS. The spectra are shown in Fig. 4. Both show unexpected concentrations of 
sulfur and chlorine. A large concentration of chlorine was detected previously on a Pd 
cathode after electrolysis (5). 


DISCUSSION OF RESULTS. 

The data in Fig. 1 present clear evidence that a nuclear 
process occurs at the surface of a palladium cathode during electrolysis in heavy water. 
Otherwise, how could the observed isotopic shifts occur over a thickness of about O. 3 µm 
? Chemical explanations for the excess heat observed for both the Pd and the Pt cathodes 
are also unlikely. The chlorine observed on these electrodes may be the result of 
transmutation of sulfur which is present in the electrolyte.
