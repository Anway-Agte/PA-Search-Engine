1 Introduction 

Energy has become a major topic of concern for human welfare both in the U.S. and worldwide. 

Many agencies and other entities of the U.S. Government have energy-related responsibilities. 

These responsibilities cover all phases of the energy "life cycle" – production, conversion, 
transport, storage, and consumption – and many associated topics, such as human health and 
environmental protection. Meeting these responsibilities involves actions and decisions that 
result in formulation of energy policy by each entity. Many agencies have particular energy 
policymaking obligations for emerging energy technologies. 

Cold fusion (referred to here as “low energy nuclear reactions”, LENR) is a potential but 
controversial new source of energy. If LENR's potential could be realized, it would be a major 
source of abundant, inexpensive, and environmentally benign energy. LENR could therefore 
contribute substantially to meeting the missions, goals and responsibilities of many government 
agencies. Many changes have occurred in the LENR field since it was rejected shortly after it 
was announced in 1989. These changes indicate that LENR's potential may yet be realized, 
which would be beneficial to human welfare and could help government agencies meet their 
energy-related responsibilities.  

A paper describing the changes in LENR prospects in relation to government agency 
responsibilities (“LENR Responsibilities”) is currently being prepared . The objective of this 
White Paper is to set the stage for the LENR Responsibilities paper by identifying the most 
relevant agencies, describing their overall mission and goals, and characterizing their specific 
energy-related interests and responsibilities. The focus of this White Paper is on agency 
responsibilities for emerging energy technologies and their secondary impacts generally. The 
LENR Responsibilities paper can then address LENR specifically for government entities.  
 Grimshaw, T.W., and D.J. Nagel, in preparation. U.S. Government Agencies Responsible for Research and 
Exploitation of Energy from Low Energy Nuclear Reactions.  

Relevant Government Entities 
The decentralized character of U.S. energy policy results in an overall policy that is asserted to 
be the cumulative policies of individual agencies. Many government agencies and other entities 
have energy-related missions and responsibilities. As noted, these responsibilities encompass the 
full energy life cycle and the associated impacts on social systems and the environment. Some 30 
entities have been identified and characterized. They are shown in Table 1.  

Methods and Information Sources  
Readily available information in the public domain has been obtained to accomplish this review 
of agencies’ energy-related obligations. Sources were accessed to characterize the 
responsibilities of each agency as represented by the agency itself. The main sources were 
agency websites, online brochures, strategic plans, manuals, procedures, annual reports, and 
other statements of agency mission, vision, and values. The topics covered for each agency are as 
follows:  
− Overall mission 
− Background, origins, and history 
− Organization 
− Energy interests and responsibilities 
− Emerging energy technologies – realization and addressing impacts  
These agency descriptions then set the stage for delineating opportunities for LENR to help the 
agencies accomplish their mission and meet their responsibilities.

2 Congressional Entities 

Both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives are deeply involved in energy-related 
concerns. Much of Congress’ energy policy work is accomplished by energy-focused 
committees, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the House Committee 
on Energy and Commerce. Energy policy development in both houses is supported by the 
Congressional Research Service (CRS), which develops information to support policymaking 
and other legislative activities. 

U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources 
The principal entity of the Senate with energy-related responsibilities is the Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources ("E&R Committee"). Its jurisdiction is broad and includes energy 
resources and development, regulation, nuclear energy, surface mining, and federal leasing for 
coal, oil, gas, and other minerals . The E&R Committee traces its jurisdiction back to 1816, 
when the Committee on Public Lands, one of the Senate’s first standing committees, was 
formed . Much of the Committee's energy-related work is done by the Subcommittee on Energy 
(“Subcommittee”). Its jurisdiction is also broad and includes :
− R&D for nuclear, coal, and synthetic fuels 
− Department of Energy (and its National Laboratories): 
− Global climate change 
− New technologies R&D 
− Commercialization of new technologies 
− Utility policy 
− Oil, gas, and coal production and distribution

The E&R Committee has been active in addressing energy issues under the current leadership. A 
wide-ranging energy synopsis ("Energy 20/20") was produced in 2013 , and a major new energy 
bill has been introduced (Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2016, EPMCA , ). Energy 20/20 


7 8

covers many of the energy issues facing the U.S. in seven sections: 
− Producing More 
− Consuming Less 
− Clean Energy Technology 
− Modernizing Energy Delivery Infrastructure 
− Effective Government 
− Environmental Responsibility 
− An Energy Policy that Pays for Itself 
The goals set forth in Energy 20/20 are to: 1) provide a basis for conversation about the future 
direction of energy policy; 2) outline policies leading to U.S. independence from OPEC oil 
imports by 2020; and 3) fund scientific research critical to continued progress . The report notes 
a consensus that it is in the national interest to "make energy abundant, affordable, clean, diverse, 
and secure" . The challenge is to "align federal law and policy with that consensus."  A number 
of white papers were prepared – apparently related to Energy 20/20 – that address a variety of 
energy-related topics including the following:

− The Energy-Water Nexus  
− Powering the Future  
− A Signal to the World  
In July 2015 the E&R Committee unveiled EMPCA (S2012) as a broad, bipartisan energy bill. 

The bill is described as follows on the Committee’s website : 
The Energy Policy Modernization Act builds on recent technological breakthroughs and promises to bring 
substantial benefits to American families and businesses while protecting the environment. It will save 
energy, expand domestic supplies, facilitate investment into critical infrastructure, protect the grid, boost 
energy trade, improve the performance of federal agencies, and renew programs that have proven effective. 

The end result will be more affordable energy, more abundant energy, and more functional energy systems 
throughout the U.S. to strengthen and sustain our energy renaissance. Best of all, the Energy Policy 
Modernization Act achieves these goals in a fiscally responsible manner. 

The bill includes five titles that include many of the topics in Energy 20/20 : 
I. Efficiency 
II. Infrastructure 
III. Supply 
IV. Accountability 
V. Conservation Reauthorization.  

EMPCA is the first comprehensive energy legislation introduced since enactment of the Energy 
Independence and Security act in 2007 . 

The broad jurisdiction and span of activities of the E&R Committee make it an excellent forum 
for promoting emerging energy technologies and dealing with their associated impacts.

U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce 
The U.S House Energy and Commerce Committee (“E&C Committee”) has the main 
responsibility for energy policy in the House of Representatives. It has the broadest jurisdiction 
of any House Committee , including national energy policy, energy resources (exploration, 
production, storage, supply, marketing, pricing, and regulation), energy conservation, energy 
information, electrical power production, nuclear energy, and oversight of the Department of 
Energy and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission . The E&C Committee was created in 1795 
and is the oldest standing committee in the House.  

The E&C Committee’s Subcommittee on Energy and Power also has broad energy-related 
jurisdiction, including national energy policy, fossil energy, renewable energy, nuclear energy 
and facilities, synthetic and alternative fuels, energy conservation, energy information, 
exploration and production, and energy efficiency .  

The E&C Committee’s Oversight Plan  addresses a number of energy and environment issues, 
including national energy policy, electricity market, management of the U.S. Department of 
Energy and its national laboratories, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, climate change, and 
investment in the green energy sector. The E&C Committee’s recent “Views and Estimates of 
the President’s Budget”  addressed several items in the budgets for the Department of Energy – 
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, Nuclear 
Energy, Fossil Energy, and Energy Information Administration. For the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, the items covered were the High-Level Waste Repository Program and Operating

Like the Senate E&R Committee, the House E&C Committee is an optimum candidate for 
supporting emerging energy technologies and dealing with their impacts. 

Congressional Research Service (CRS) 
The Congressional Research Service (CRS) is a public policy research entity that “works 
exclusively for the United States Congress, providing policy and legal analysis to committees 
and Members of both the House and Senate, regardless of party affiliation.”  Its mission is to 
serve “the Congress throughout the legislative process by providing comprehensive and reliable 
legislative research and analysis that are timely, objective, authoritative and confidential, thereby 
contributing to an informed national legislature.”   
The CRS works closely with Members of Congress and congressional committees at all stages of 
the legislative process “from the early considerations that precede bill drafting, through 
committee hearings and floor debate, to the oversight of enacted laws and various agency 
activities.”  CRS does not make policy or legislative recommendations but instead develops 
information to support policymaking by Members of Congress and their staff.  

CRS was created by Congress in 1970 from the former Legislative Reference Service, which had 
existed since 1946. It is located in Washington, D.C. and has about 600 employees, most of 
whom are policy analysts, attorneys, and information professionals. The agency is 
organizationally within the Library of Congress and has five research divisions:  


1. American Law 

2. Domestic Social Policy 

3. Foreign Affairs, Defense and Trade 

4. Government and Finance 

5. Resources, Science and Industry

 About CRS. Online. Available: http://www.loc.gov/crsinfo/about/. 


27 Areas of Research. Online. Available: http://www.loc.gov/crsinfo/research/. 


CRS performs analysis and provides assistance to Congress “in the form of reports, memoranda, 
customized briefings, seminars, digitally recorded presentations, information obtained from 
governmental and nongovernmental databases, and consultations in person and by telephone.”  
Its values are to be confidential, authoritative, objective, and nonpartisan.  Support to Congress 
includes several categories of services and products :  
− Congressionally Distributed Products Providing Research and Analysis on Legislative 
Issues 
− Electronically Accessible Products and Services 
− Responses to Individual Members and Committees 
− Seminars, Institutes, and Other Programs 
− Outreach 
− Legislative Summaries, Digests, and Compilations 
− Other Services 
CRS work is accomplished at the direction of a member of Congress or one of the congressional 
committees. Because its research services are focused on Congress, and by statutory mandate in 
the laws appropriating its funds, CRS does not routinely make its reports available to the public. 

The lack of complete availability to the public has become somewhat controversial, so the CRS 
has made its policy clear on access to its reports with several interrelated precepts:   
− CRS is a resource dedicated solely to meeting the needs of Congress.  
− The confidential relationship with Congress is preserved by restricting access to CRS 
products. 
− Communications from the CRS to Congress are confidential and constitutionally 
protected.  
− The role of CRS staff as “adjunct staff” to the Congress could be altered by speaking 
directly to the public.

− If the audience becomes the public at large, CRS would no longer be focused on 
congressional needs. 
− Responding to congressional constituents as members of the public could threaten the 
dialogue between Members of Congress and their constituents. 

Over 700 new CRS reports are produced each year; almost 4,000 are in existence.  Much of 
CRS research has in recent years apparently been devoted to responses to constituents of 
Members of Congress, perhaps resulting in less emphasis on policy research.  

Because energy policy has been an important issue for the U.S. Congress since the major crises 
in the 1970s, CRS has produced a number of reports to help inform congressional action on 
energy topics. Energy-related research is conducted in the Resources, Industry and the 
Environment Division , whose coverage includes Energy and Minerals as one of six sections. 

This section addresses seven topics: 
− Conventional energy supply, prices and security 
− Energy efficiency and conservation 
− Renewable and alternative energy 
− Emerging energy technology 
− Environmental effects of energy production and consumption 
− Energy infrastructure, taxation and regulation 
− Mineral production and use 
One example CRS energy policy report is a recent description of energy in the U.S., which 
provides broad coverage, including oil, natural gas, coal, electricity, renewables, and 
conservation and energy efficiency.  Other energy-related CRS reports address contemporary

energy storage . A recent CRS Annual Report  described five energy-specific Resources, 
Industry, and the Environment topics:  
− Crude Oil and Petroleum Products 
− Liquefied Natural Gas and Crude Oil Exports 
− Electric Utilities 
− Propane Storage 
− EPA's Proposed Clean Power Plan 
This report also listed the Keystone XL Pipeline and hydraulic fracturing as two of the major 
issues addressed by the CRS in FY2014. Another recent energy policy report outlined three 
major U.S. policy goals since the oil embargos of the 1970s : 
− Assure a secure supply of energy 
− Keep energy costs low enough to meet the needs of a growing economy 
− Protect the environment during energy production and consumption 
Replacing conventional energy sources was addressed specifically, with emphasis on replacing 
fossil fuels with biofuels (ethanol and non-food sources) and renewable sources such as wind, 
solar (concentrating and photovoltaic), and geothermal sources. It is noted that a principal 
emphasis of past congressional programs has been on environmental concerns, especially

greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change. It is also noted that development of new 
industrial products from increasing renewable energy sources has been a significant theme of 
past programs. Also, nuclear power is being considered as a viable alternative to fossil energy in 
spite of its long history as a target of environmental concerns.  

If either the Senate or the House chooses to take up energy-related issues, including emerging 
technologies and their related impacts, the Resources, Industry, and Environment Division of the 
CRS is well positioned and highly qualified to provide the necessary information and evaluation 
support for Congressional policymaking. 


3 Executive Entities 

The President, along with Congress, provides leadership for energy policymaking for the nation. 

Many agencies and other entities in the Executive branch have energy-related responsibilities 
and develop energy policy. These entities are within the Executive Office of the President, are 
Cabinet-level Departments, or function as independent agencies.  

Executive Office 
Three entities within the Executive Office have responsibilities for policy development on 
science and technology, including energy-related topics – the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy (OSTP), the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), and the President’s 
Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).  

The OSTP mission has three components : 1) provide the President and his senior staff with 
accurate, relevant, and timely scientific and technical advice on all matters of consequence; 2) 
ensure that the policies of the Executive Branch are informed by sound science; and 3) be sure 
that the scientific and technical work of the Executive Branch is properly coordinated so as to 
provide the greatest benefit to society. It was established in 1976 to advise the President on the 
effects of science and technology on domestic and international affairs. The OSTP leads 
interagency efforts to develop and implement sound science and technology policies and 
budgets, and to work with the private sector, state and local governments, the science and higher 
education communities, and other nations toward this end . OSTP’s four strategic goals and 
objectives may be summarized as follows: 


1. Maximize the contribution of U.S. investments in science and technology to 
economic prosperity, public health, environmental quality, and national security 
2. Facilitate the processes of government programs in science and technology 
3. Sustain core relationships required to understand U.S. scientific and technical efforts, 
evaluate advances, and identify policy proposals 
 About OSTP. Online. Available: https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/about 
45 About OSTP. Online. Available: https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/about. 
4. Maintain staff with expertise to provide policy advice to the President on the 
scientific and technical aspects of government policies and programs. 

The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) and President’s Council of Advisors on 
Science and Technology (PCAST) are also within the Executive Office of the President. The 
NSTC coordinates science and technology policies among the Federal entities conducting 
research and development. The NSTC is chaired by the President, and its membership consists of 
the Vice President, the Director of the OSTP, and Cabinet Secretaries and Agency Heads having 
significant science and technology responsibilities. The NSTC objective is to establish national 
goals for Federal science and technology investments. It was established by Executive Order in 


1993. Most of its work is accomplished in five committees: Environment, Natural Resources and 

Sustainability; Homeland and National Security; Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math 
(STEM) Education; Science; and Technology.  

PCAST is an advisory group to the President that includes leading U.S. scientists and engineers 
that was created in 2009 . It is co-chaired by the Director of the OSTP and makes policy 
recommendations regarding science, technology, and innovation where they are key to 
strengthening the economy and forming workable policies.  

The OSTP, NSTC, and PCAST must be fully engaged in energy-related issues to provide 
executive leadership and meet their policy advisory responsibilities for science and engineering 
policy. The U.S. Global Climate Change Research Program, for example, is steered by the 
NSTC’s Subcommittee on Global Change Research and is overseen by the OSTP . Realization 
of emerging energy technologies and dealing with their impacts are prime candidates for 
Executive Office energy policy leadership. 

U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is the primary agency dealing with energy-related topics 
and policymaking. The DOE is a cabinet-level Department whose mission is to ensure America’s

security and prosperity by addressing its energy, environmental and nuclear challenges through 
transformative science and technology solutions . 

Four components of DOE in particular are relevant to policies and practices for non-fossil 
emerging energy technologies. The Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E), 
the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), the National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory (NREL), and the National Laboratories, with Los Alamos National Laboratory 
(LANL) as a primary example). The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is focused 
on fossil energy technology and is not included in this White Paper. Also, DOE’s Energy 
Information Agency (EIA) deals more with developing and providing data and less with energy 
policymaking and is not included. DOE Headquarters is described below first, followed by each 
of the four selected components. 

DOE Overall 
The DOE is organized into three principal components headed by Undersecretaries who report to 
the office of the Secretary – Nuclear Security, Science and Energy, and Management and 
Performance . In addition, sixteen organizational units also report to the Office of the Secretary, 
including the Energy Information Administration, four Power Administrations (Western, 
Southwestern, Southeastern, and Bonneville), Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs, 
International Affairs, and Energy Policy and Systems Analysis. 

The Secretary of Energy receives advice and recommendations from an advisory board 
(Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, SEAB) on such topics as basic and applied R&D, 
economic and national security policy, education issues, and other activities as directed by the 
Secretary . The SEAB consists of 19 members (including a chair and vice chair) having a broad 
range of expertise, such as environmental protection, economics, law, medicine, and policy.  

The DOE was created under the provisions of the Department of Energy Organization Act of 


1977 as the twelfth cabinet-level department. Two long-standing "programmatic traditions"

within the Federal government were brought together in the reorganization. : 1) defense 
responsibilities that included the design, construction, and testing of nuclear weapons dating 
from the Manhattan Project; and 2) a loosely knit amalgamation of energy-related programs 
scattered throughout the government. Two factors brought these traditions together: 
− Nuclear energy development and commercialization by the Atomic Energy 
Commission (the Federal government's most significant energy project of the 1970s) 
− Efforts to better coordinate Federal energy policy programs in response to the energy 
crises of the 1970s 
DOE took responsibility for a framework for a national energy plan, long-term and high-risk 
energy R&D, energy conservation and regulatory programs, the nuclear weapons program, and 
energy data collection and analysis. 

Since its beginnings, the DOE has varied its emphasis in response to changing national needs . 

Energy development and regulation took priority during the late 1970s. Nuclear weapons 
research, development, and production were emphasized in the 1980s. After the end of the Cold 
War, focus was placed on the cleanup of the nuclear weapons complex and nuclear 
nonproliferation in the 1990s. Since 2000, the DOE has placed priority on ensuring U.S. security 
and prosperity. 

The DOE Strategic Plan  includes three main goals, one for each of the Undersecretary 
organizations noted above. The most significant unit for emerging energy technologies is 
Science and Energy, whose goal includes three Strategic Objectives: 


1. Advance the goals and objectives in the President’s Climate Action Plan by 
supporting prudent development, deployment, and efficient use of “all of the above” 
energy resources that also create new jobs and industries 
2. Support a more economically competitive, environmentally responsible, secure and 
resilient U.S. energy infrastructure

3. Deliver the scientific discoveries and major scientific tools that transform our 
understanding of nature and strengthen the connection between advances in 
fundamental science and technology innovation 
The third Strategic Objective in turn encompasses three strategies: 
− Conduct discovery-focused research to increase our understanding of matter, 
materials and their properties through partnerships with universities, national 
laboratories, and industry  
− Provide the nation’s researchers with world-class scientific user facilities that enable 
mission-focused research and advance scientific discovery 
− Use the national laboratory system and leverage partnerships with universities and 
industry to conduct mission-focused research 
Particularly at the Headquarters level, DOE is a principal player in developing policy toward and 
providing support for emerging energy technologies as well as dealing with their secondary 
impacts. 

Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E) 
Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E) is particularly relevant for supporting 
new technologies as sources of energy. Its mission is to catalyze and accelerate the creation of 
transformational energy technologies by making investments in the early stages of 
development . ARPA-E advances high-potential high-impact energy technologies that are too 
early for private-sector investment. The agency focuses on transformational projects that have 
the potential to radically improve U.S. economics, prosperity, national security, and 
environmental well being . The ARPA-E model is based on the successful Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which is credited with many innovations  and is described 
below in Section 3.3.3.

 The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy: Overview. Online. Available: http://arpa-
e.energy.gov/sites/default/files/ARPA-E_FactSheet.pdf. 

The impetus for creation of ARPA-E was a report by the National Academies, “Rising Above the 
Gathering Storm , which recommended an agency similar to DARPA within the DOE. The 
agency was authorized in 2007 (The America COMPETES Act), and its initial projects were 
funded in 2009 . Over 400 energy technology projects have been funded since 2009.  

ARPA-E seeks to streamline the program development and awards process with two models – 
“focused” programs and “open” solicitations . The focused programs are developed by ARPA-E 
program directors to address specific program challenges. Open funding opportunities pursue 
novel approaches to energy innovations that are outside the scope of existing focused 
programs . ARPA-E's process advances early-stage technologies to market with four 
strategies : 
− Strategic Partnerships with private companies to advance along a clear path to market 
- after their time with ARPA-E 
− New Company Formation - to facilitate the commercialization process for 
technologies  
− Public-Development - with other government entities to further advance ARPA-E 
sponsored projects 
− Follow-On Investment - from private investors during and after an ARPA-E award. 

By the very nature of its creation, existence, and mission, ARPA-E is a prime entity for 
researching and realizing emerging energy technologies. 

Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) 
The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) is another DOE component 
whose emphasis is on investigation of emerging energy technologies. Its mission is “to create

and sustain American leadership in the global transition to a clean energy economy” . This 
mission includes high-impact research, development, and demonstration to make clean energy as 
affordable and convenient as traditional forms of energy as well as breaking down barriers to 
market entry. EERE is “at the center of creating the clean energy economy today. EERE leads 
the U.S. Department of Energy's efforts to develop and deliver market-driven solutions for 
energy-saving homes, buildings, and manufacturing; sustainable transportation; and renewable 
electricity generation” .  

EERE invests in clean energy technologies that strengthen the economy, reduce dependence on 
foreign oil, and protect the environment . EERE leverages partnerships with the private sector, 
state and local governments, DOE national laboratories, and universities to transform the 
nation’s economic engine to one powered by clean energy. The agency was formed in 2001 
when it was renamed and reorganized from a predecessor organization, the Office of 
Conservation and Solar Energy . EERE’s five guiding principles are as follows : 
1. High Impact: Is this a high impact problem? 
2. Additionality: Will the EERE funding make a large difference relative to what the 
private sector (or other funding entities) is already doing? 
3. Openness: Have we made sure to focus on the broad problem we are trying to solve 
and be open to new ideas, new approaches, and new performers? 
4. Enduring U.S. Economic Benefit: How will this EERE funding result in enduring 
economic benefit to the United States? 
5. Proper Role Of Government: Why is what we are doing a proper high impact role of 
government versus something best left to the private sector to address on its own?

The Assistant Secretary at the head of EERE reports to DOE’s Undersecretary for Science and 
Energy . The principal organization components are Energy Efficiency, Renewable Energy, 
Business Operations, and Strategic Programs . 

With its principal emphasis on developing new technologies for clean energy, EERE is a prime 
example of a government agency having emerging energy technology responsibilities.  

National Renewal Energy Laboratory (NREL) 
The National Renewal Energy Laboratory (NREL) is organizationally within EERE and has a 
similar emphasis on realizing energy from new technologies. NREL's mission is to develop 
“clean energy and energy efficiency technologies and practices, advance related science and 
engineering, and provide knowledge and innovations to integrate energy systems at all scales.”  
NREL is the primary “research facility for the Department of Energy’s Office of Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Energy (OEERE), Office of Science, and Office of Electricity 
Delivery and Energy Reliability”. The NREL also provides technical assistance, energy planning 
and economic development for many organizations and industries in the U.S. The laboratory is 
managed for the DOE by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC, a partnership between 
Battelle Memorial Institute and MRIGlobal (Midwest Research Institute). Roughly 80% of the 
NREL’s funding comes from the OEERE, with the balance coming from other DOE and outside 
sources.”  NREL is “the only federal laboratory dedicated to the research, development, 
commercialization, and deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies.”  
NREL performs analysis to inform “policy and investment decisions as energy-efficient and 
renewable energy technologies advance from concept to commercial application to market 
penetration. With objective, technology-neutral analysis, NREL aims to increase the 
understanding of energy policies, markets, resources, technologies, and infrastructure and

NREL was initiated “as the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI) in 1977, spurred by national 
concern during the 1973 oil embargo. President George H.W. Bush elevated SERI to a national 
laboratory, and its name was changed to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Whereas 
SERI’s roots were dedicated to harnessing power from the sun, NREL is dedicated to all forms 
of renewable energy and energy efficiency – and to working with industry to transfer innovative 
ideas into the marketplace.”  
NREL receives about $380 million a year in funding. It has “a unique, world-class workforce. 

The staff at NREL is highly educated, with 31% holding doctorate degrees and another 32% with 
master’s degrees. The staff includes citizens from 55 countries, with the majority (57%) 
contributing in core research and development.”  Like its parent organization (EERE), NREL

U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) 
The mission of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is to provide the military forces needed to 
deter war and to protect the security of our country . It is America’s oldest and largest 
government agency. The President is the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Armed Forces, and 
the DoD is headed by the Secretary of Defense.  

DoD Overall 
The principal components of the DoD are the three Departments (Army, Navy, and Air Force), 
the Unified Combatant Commands (UCCs), the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) . In general, the three Departments (Services) train and equip the 
fighting forces, and the nine UCCs have overall command of the forces in military operations. 

The JCS consists of senior leaders who advise the Secretary of Defense. The OSD is the 
executive support organization for the Secretary of Defense. It provides policy development, 
management of resources, overall planning, and oversight of programs. It is also responsible for 
managing the DOD Agencies and Field Activities organizations . 

The DoD is one of the largest single consumers of energy in the world and therefore has a very 
high interest in energy security. The agency is by far the largest energy consumer in the U.S. 
government (about 80% of the total) . DoD's energy policy, as established by a 2014 DoD 
Directive, is "to enhance military capability, improve energy security, and mitigate costs in its 
use and management of energy" . The Directive states that the DoD will develop and acquire 
technologies that meet the agency's energy needs and manage risks.  

The critical role of energy in enabling DoD to accomplish its mission has become increasingly 
recognized in the agency. DoD’s energy consumption is managed in two primary categories –

operations and installations. Energy is basic to assuring military capability and the ability to 
project and sustain U.S. military power . This recognition led to the creation in 2010 of the 
position of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy and Programs
, . The 2016 


95 96

Operational Energy Strategy sets forth the objective of increasing war fighting capability by 
including energy throughout future force development and reducing risks from operational 
energy vulnerabilities vulnerability .  

Overall responsibility for Operational Energy is in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment . This Office also has responsibility for 
Installation Energy, which issues facility energy policy and guidance  and oversees the DoD 
Facility Energy Program
. This Program focuses on three primary objectives: 1) expand 
supply; 2) reduce demand; and 3) adopt future forces and technology
. The fixed installations 
are critical in ensuring military readiness and account for about 30% of DOD energy use. 

Given the large quantities of energy that DoD consumes, and the increasingly recognized 
importance of energy in accomplishing its mission, the agency maintains a strong position in 
developing and emerging energy technologies. 

Energy & Power Community of Interest (COI)

technology investment across the DoD
. DOD's "Research and Engineering (R&E) Enterprise" 
is broad and includes the military departments, DARPA, DTRA, DoD laboratories, other 
government laboratories, university affiliated research centers, government laboratories of allies, 
and the industrial base
. The R&E Enterprise Guidance outlines three “enduring principles” – 
eliminate or mitigate technology-based national security threats, enable new or extended military 
capabilities, and create technology surprise
. The DoD is a potent engine of technological 
innovation and has unparalleled energy demands for national defense
. At the same time, the 
agency’s primary mission is to deter war and protect the country’s security, which may pose 
limitations on its contributions to energy-related technological advances. 

Reliance 21 has been set up as an overarching framework for DOD's Science and Technology 
planning and coordination
. Under Reliance 21, Communities of Interest (COIs) have been 
established in 17 areas of focus to review the alignment of R&E programs, identify gaps, and 
help prioritize funding
. The role of the COIs is to help deliver maximum science and 
technology impact with reduced risk by engaging the participants and enhancing collaboration
The COIs were established as a mechanism to encourage coordination and collaboration among 
agencies in cross-cutting technology focus areas. They provide a forum for coordinating science 
and technology strategies across DoD, sharing new ideas, technical directions, and technology 
opportunities

Within the DoD, the E&P COI is closely engaged with the capabilities and facilities of the three 
Services – Army (3 labs), Navy (5 labs), and Air Force (2 labs)
. The E&P COI also works 
closely with DOE National Labs in several areas
, including Oak Ridge's National 
Transportation Center, Sandia's Distributed Energy Tech Lab, and Pacific Northwest's Energy 
Infrastructure Operations Center.  

With its focus on Operational Energy
, the E&P COI recognizes four major areas – soldiers, 
forward operating bases (base camps), ground and air vehicles, and tactical operations centers 
(combat outpost)
. Five areas of opportunity have been identified to support war fighters
− Tactical Unit Energy Independence 
− Autonomous Platform Power 
− Electric Weapons and High Power Sensors 
− Adaptive Power Networks 
− Energy Optimized Platforms 
Five gaps have been identified for Operational Energy requirements
− High efficiency energy conversion and harvesting 
− Energy integrated system and simulation design and simulation 
− High efficiency propulsion and platform design 
− Environmental control systems 
− Flexible and adaptive power distribution

Clearly, emerging energy technologies are at the core of the E&P COI purpose and research 
programs.  

Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) 
DARPA's mission is to "make the pivotal early technology investments that create or prevent 
technological surprise for U.S. national security"
. Another statement of DARPA's mission is 
"to identify and pursue high-risk, high-payoff research initiatives across a broad spectrum of 
science and engineering disciplines and to transform these initiatives into important, radically 
new, game-changing technologies for U.S. national security".

DARPA was created in February 1958 as a direct response to the launch by the Soviet Union of 
Sputnik 1 in 1957 and of the first Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) also in that year
Since this traumatic experience of technological surprise, DARPA has owned responsibility for 
keeping the U.S. out front in cultivating breakthroughs for national security. 

The focus of DARPA continues to be on game-changing military capabilities, but its efforts also 
lead to major technological advances in modern civilian society
. As an entity whose primary 
focus is on technological advances
, DARPA seeks to maintain a culture of creativity and risk 
tolerance. Achieving major impact means for DARPA taking on high-risk in prospect of high 
payoff
. The agency recognizes four factors that define its creative culture and explain its 
history of innovation – limited tenure and the urgency it promotes, a sense of mission, trust and 
autonomy, and risk-taking and tolerance of failure

The Heilmeier questions ("catechism") continues to be an invaluable tool for illuminating the 
process of refining and judging which are the most promising ideas
− What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon. 
− How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice? 
− What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful? 
− Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make? 
− What are the risks and payoffs? 
− How much will it cost? 
− What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success? 

DARPA is viewed within DOD as the disruption engine behind the department's technology 
enterprise
. It works on-cutting-edge technologies that are fundamentally changing the future 
and seeks to bring that future into today. Despite the daunting security challenges that motivate 
its work, the atmosphere within DARPA is persistently one of excitement and even joy


131 132

DARPA has no research and development facilities of its own, but it has become known as an 
incubator of innovation by providing thought leadership, community-building frameworks, 
research management, funding, and other support elements required to bring transformative ideas 
to consequential new realities
. The agency is located in Arlington, Virginia, where it has about 


220 employees. It pursues its objectives through programs and utilizing a portfolio approach. 


DARPA has six technology offices
 where its 200-plus programs are managed by almost 100 
program managers. The budget for FY 2016 was $2.87 billion
. The agency reaches for 
transformational change rather than incremental advances. It does not perform in isolation, but

works within an “innovation ecosystem that includes academic, corporate, and governmental 
partners”.

Emphasis is placed at DARPA on transitioning its research results into applicable, real-world 
domains of military capabilities for the civilian sector
. Transitions can follow different paths, 
such as to one or more Services (e.g., Army, Navy, Air Force) for further development or to an 
element of the private sector where commercial forces come into play. 

By making pivotal early investments in technologies to prevent strategic surprise, DARPA has 
made a number of notable achievements
. These accomplishments include the conceptual basis 
for the precursor to the Internet, advances supporting speech recognition, touch-screen displays, 
and wireless capabilities as the core of smartphones and tablets. DARPA has also made advances 
in aircraft stealth (low observability) technology, infrared night imaging, size reduction of GPS 
receivers (enabling change of "dumb bombs" to smart munitions, and advances in the use of 
unmanned aerial vehicles (drones). 

Given the increased emphasis of DOD on the role of energy in military capability, such as the 
creation of the Office of Operational Energy in 2011, DARPA appears to have strong potential 
interest in energy technologies. The goal of the Materials for Transduction (MATRIX) program 
in the Defense Sciences Office, for example, is to extend materials breakthroughs for converting 
energy between different forms, such as thermal to electric energy or electric field to magnetic 
fields. The MATRIX program seeks to further the transition of games and materials research into 
new devices and DOD capabilities
. DARPA may have the opportunity for future programs 
that are focused on emerging energy technologies to meet DOD's recognition of the vital 
importance of energy in accomplishing its mission of deterring war and prepared protecting the 
security of the US.

U.S. DoD Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) 
The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) works to stop the spread, counter the effects, 
and prepare for the use of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs)
. The agency was created in 


1998 from a number of previously existing entities to focus their efforts on terrorism, our nuclear 

surety, and counter-proliferation
. It is co-located at Fort Belvoir, Virginia with two other 
entities concerned with WMDs, both of which are elements of the U.S. Strategic Command, 
whereas DTRA is responsible to an Under Secretary of Defense . DTRA and the other two 
entities "work together to leverage our unique authorities in our world-class professional staff to 
counter the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction" . This three members of the team have 
unified their individual missions into a single, shared mission: "Safeguard the United States and 
its allies from global WMD threats by integrating, synchronizing, and providing expertise, 
technologies, and capabilities . The team shares five values: integrity, service, excellence, 
innovation, and teamwork . Their goals are to make the world safer, safeguard the U.S. and its 
allies from global WMD threats, function as one team, and effectively use resources .  

DTRA's R&D efforts are in basic and applied science, chemical/biological technologies, counter 
WMD technologies, and nuclear technologies . Its success stories include its efforts to control 
the Ebola virus, nuclear detection, biosurveillance, and assisting other countries (the Philippines) 
in building chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear response capability .

DTRA's current research does not appear to emphasize energy in general or on emerging energy 
technologies specifically
. Nevertheless, the potential implications for national security if 
LENR were to be developed by an adversarial nation have apparently caused DTRA to engage in 
the field. Examples of DTRA-supported LENR research are a 2007 report on high energy 
science and technology that included a LENR panel
, a 2012 report of a study utilizing 
palladium and nickel wires , and a 2016 report of an investigation of nano-nuclear reactions in 
condensed matter

use of information, accelerate new capabilities to the fleet, and develop game-changing or 
fighting concepts
The Navy and Marine Corps are significant users of energy within the DOD context, consuming 
about one-third of the total for the three Services
. Energy-related topics therefore play a major 
role in setting the Navy's priorities. For example, the Fiscal Year 2016 Goals and 
Accomplishments
 includes four categories – People, Platforms, Power, and Partnerships. The 
Power category includes five components: 
− Increase alternative energy Navy-wide 
− Sail the Great Green Fleet 
− Leverage 1 gigawatt execution to improve energy security 
− Institutionalize resource and energy efficiency throughout the Navy 
− Develop an integrated energy security and resiliency. 

The Energy Goals of the Department of the Navy (DON) are also set forth as follows


158 159

− Energy Efficient Acquisition: Evaluation of energy factors will be mandatory when 
awarding contracts for systems and buildings. 
− Sail the "Great Green Fleet": DON will demonstrate a Green Strike Group in local 
operations by 2012 and sail it by 2016. 
− Reduce Non-Tactical Petroleum Use: By 2015, DON will reduce petroleum use in the 
commercial fleet by 50%. 
− Increase Alternative Energy Ashore: By 2020, DON will produce at least 50% of 
shore-based energy requirements from alternative sources; 50% of DON installations 
will be net-zero 
− Increase Alternative Energy Use DON-Wide: By 2020, 50% of total DON energy 
consumption will come from alternative sources Energy 
The Navy has extensive scientific and technological capabilities to meet its future requirements, 
including its energy needs. For example, a major section of the Navy's 2015 Program Guide

Technology Evaluation Program (ESTEP).  

The Navy recognizes that "ashore and afloat" its energy efforts cross three functional areas – 
physical and strategic security, research and development, and policy and doctrine
. Its energy 
strategy is developed using a governance structure – Task Force Energy – composed of Working 
Groups, an Energy Transition Office, and an Executive Steering Committee. The Task Force 
Energy charter calls for setting up processes, tools, metrics, and structure to support the Navy 
Energy Strategy and establishes seven Working Groups that are involved in the Navy's energy-
related activities
.A Navy Energy Coordination Office (NECO) has been set up to support the 
Task Force Energy and coordinate the overall Navy Energy Strategy. 8 It is located 
organizationally in the Energy and Environmental Readiness Division
In support of its energy goals, the Navy pursues science and technology investments in 
alternative fuel sources, energy distribution and control, energy storage, and power generation 
and loads
. Within power generation, the Navy is exploring the development of technologies to 
improve fuel efficiency, increased power density, and reduce emissions for air, ground, sea 
surface, and undersea applications
. Example research areas are fuel cells, shipboard hybrid 
drive, high-efficiency aircraft engines, and hybrid photovoltaic devices. 
3.3.5.2 U.S. Navy Office of Naval Research (ONR) 
The Office of Naval Research (ONR) managers and funds basic and applied science and 
advanced technology development through the use of grants and contracts with partners in 
academia, industry, and government in the U.S. and around the world
. It was established in 


1946 as the U.S. Government's first permanent agency devoted to funding civilian research

during peacetime. 1020B The head of ONR, the Chief of Naval Research, reports to the Assistant 
Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development, and Acquisition). 

ONR has two-high-level Directorates – Office of Research and Office of Technology – to 
accomplish its mission
. The Office of Research makes broad investments in basic and applied 
research that will increase fundamental knowledge, fosters opportunities for breakthroughs, and 
provides technology options for future Naval capabilities. This Office includes the SwampWorks 
Program, which explores innovative, high-risk and disruptive technologies and concepts
. It 
provides for short exploratory studies to examine the maturation of a proposed technology before 
substantial investments are made. ONR's Office of Technology emphasizes transition of 
programs covering manufacturing methods for Naval warfare systems, stimulating government-
industry partnerships, and focusing on requirements from the fleet and acquisition
The ONR's Naval Science & Technology Strategy
 identifies the strategic approach and adjusts 
the principles of the strategy to current guidance from naval leaders. It guides ongoing research 
by Naval scientists and engineers as the Department maintains a broad portfolio of initiatives to 
build the future force. The 2015 Science & Technology Strategy includes nine Focus Areas 
1060, one of which is Power and Energy. This Focus Area has objectives in three categories: 
− Efficient Power and Energy Systems 
− Energy Security 
− High Energy and Pulsed Power 
The Energy System Technology Evaluation Program (ESTEP) within ONR is designed to 
leverage Navy research in combination with the best from commercial sector advances
ESTEP conducts real-world advanced-technology demonstrations to evaluate emerging energy 
technologies using Navy and Marine Corps facilities as test beds. The technology focuses on

market sourcing, including companies from within the venture capital and small business 
communities. 

Clearly, ONR places a high priority on emerging energy technologies to meet its energy-related 
science and technology objectives. 
3.3.5.3 U.S. Navy Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) 
The mission of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is to conduct a broadly based 
multidisciplinary program of scientific research and advanced technological development 
directed toward maritime applications of new and improved materials, techniques, equipment, 
systems, and ocean, atmospheric, and space sciences and related technologies
. As the Navy's 
single, integrated Corporate Laboratory, NRL provides a broad foundation of in-house expertise 
from scientific to advanced development activity
. The creation of NRL in the early 1920s was 
instigated by Thomas Edison, who conceived the idea of "a great laboratory"
NRL's research is conducted in a Base Program, which consists of Basic Research – with 
emphasis on scientific study for increasing knowledge and broad fields for long-term Navy needs 
– and Applied Research, where efforts are directed toward solution of specific Navy problems 
(short of major development projects)
. The seven focus areas of the NRL Base Program are: 
− Battlespace Environments 
− Electronics 
− Electromagnetic Warfare 
− Information Technology 
− Materials & Chemistry 
− Space Research and Space Technology 
− Undersea Warfare

NRL is organized into two Directorates with emphasis on management – Commanding Officer 
(Code 1000) and Business Operations (Code 2000) and four technical Directorates
− Systems (Code 5000) 
− Material Science and Component Technology (Code 6000) 
− Ocean and Atmospheric Science and Technology (Code 7000) 
− Naval Center for Space Technology (Code 8000) 
Eighteen Divisions and Laboratories with different areas of emphasis are organized within the 
Directorates
. Although an emphasis on emerging energy technologies at NRL is not apparent, 
the laboratory clearly possesses the talent and facilities for their development when required. 

U.S. Department of Commerce – Patent and Trade Office (PTO) 
The U.S. Patent and Trade Office (PTO) is a particularly important agency for realization of 
emerging energy technologies. The PTO “is the federal agency for granting U.S. patents and 
registering trademarks. In doing this, the USPTO fulfills the mandate of Article I, Section 8, 
Clause 8, of the Constitution that the legislative branch ‘promote the Progress of Science and 
useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their 
respective Writings and Discoveries.’ The USPTO registers trademarks based on the commerce 
clause of the Constitution (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3).”
The PTO mission is as follows
: “Fostering innovation, competitiveness and economic growth, 
domestically and abroad by delivering high quality and timely examination of patent and 
trademark applications, guiding domestic and international intellectual property policy, and 
delivering intellectual property information and education worldwide, with a highly-skilled, 
diverse workforce”. 

The USPTO “advises the president of the United States, the secretary of commerce, and U.S. 
government agencies on intellectual property (IP) policy, protection, and enforcement; and

and encourage the development of strong IP enforcement regimes by U.S. trading partners.”
The PTO is “an agency within the United States Department of Commerce (DOC). The Office is 
led by the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO, 
who consults with the Patent Public Advisory Committee (PPAC) and the Trademark Public 
Advisory Committee (TPAC) on Office policies, goals, performance, budget, and user fees.”
The PTO was formed in 1836 after a lengthy prior history of granting patents by the U.S. as 
provided in the Constitution. Its headquarters are in Alexandria, Virginia, and offices are being 
or have recently been set up in Detroit, Dallas, Denver, and the Silicon Valley in California. The 
PTO has four strategic goals, each of which includes several objectives

Energy devices, technologies, and products comprise an important component of PTO’s 
intellectual protection responsibilities. Several energy-related categories have been established 
for both patents and trademarks. Intellectual property protection of emerging energy technologies 
is essential for PTO to accomplish its mission.  

U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is one of the nation’s premier 
organizations for developing emerging technologies, including new sources of energy for a 
variety of applications. NASA's vision is “to reach for new heights and reveal the unknown for 
the benefit of humankind”
. The mission is to “drive advances in science, technology, 
aeronautics, and space exploration to enhance knowledge, education, innovation, economic 
vitality, and stewardship of Earth”
. NASA’s strategic goals are to:  
− Expand the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunity in space 
− Advance understanding of Earth and develop technologies to improve the quality of 
life on our home planet 
− Serve the American public and accomplish our Mission by effectively managing 
people, technical capabilities, and infrastructure.  

Each of these goals includes a number of objectives that provide more specific guidance. The 
agency is organized into four “mission directorates”: aeronautics research, human exploration

and operations, science, and space technologies
.  NASA has missions, programs and projects 
that ensure “the United States will remain the world's leader in space exploration and scientific 
discovery for years to come, while making critical advances in aerospace, technology 
development and aeronautics.”
 NASA is an independent federal agency (organizationally 
outside the president’s cabinet). It was established in 1958 as a civilian (rather than military) 
entity to encourage peaceful applications in space science.  

Energy interests at NASA are broad, but three areas are particularly important – propulsion of 
space probes and planetary exploration, aircraft propulsion, and addressing global climate 
change. Sources of energy for space probe propulsion are investigated for within and outside the 
reach of solar radiation as a power source. For example, alternatives to nuclear fission sources 
(radioisotope thermoelectric generators, RPGs) are sought as power sources for deep space 
probes. Propulsion research for probes falls within Objective 1.7 (“Transform NASA missions 
and advance the Nation’s capabilities by maturing crosscutting and innovative space 
technologies”) of Strategic Goal 1.  

NASA also investigates alternative methods of aircraft propulsion, with emphasis on low-carbon 
propulsion as one of six major research areas of its aeronautics research program
. This 
program is included in Objective 2.1 (“Enable a revolutionary transformation for safe and 
sustainable U.S. and global aviation by advancing aeronautics research”) of Strategic Goal 2. 

Carbon dioxide emissions from the use of fossil fuels underlie global climate change, another 
major research focus of NASA. NASA’s Earth Science Research Program seeks to measure 
global climate change to inform decisions by the government, organizations, and people around 
the world
. Climate change is included within Objective 2.2 (“Advance knowledge of Earth as 
a system to meet the challenges of environmental change, and to improve life on our planet”) of 
Strategic Goal 2.

Developing new sources of energy and realization of emerging energy technologies are 
fundamental for NASA to accomplish its mission as well as its Strategic Goals. 

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has long played a role in dealing with energy-
related impacts, including developing new or emerging technologies both for clean energy 
sources and for dealing with the residuals of existing energy sources, especially fossil fuel based 
energy. EPA’s mission is “to protect human health and the environment”.
 It lists seven 
purposes, which may be summarized as follows: 


1. Protect Americans from risks to human health and the environment 

2. Reduce risks based on scientific information 

3. Enforce federal environmental laws 

4. Assure that environmental protection is considered in U.S. policies 

5. Maintain public access to information to participate in managing risks 

6. Make communities and ecosystems diverse, sustainable, and economically productive 

7. Assure that the U.S. is a leader in protecting the global environment 

EPA was created in 1970 in response to increasing public concern about the effects of human 
activities on the environment. It is an independent agency and is not a part of the President’s 
cabinet. It has 13 organizational offices that cover various aspects of protection of human health 
and the environment, including water, air and radiation, chemical safety and pollution 
prevention, research and development, and solid waste and emergency response. 

All phases of the energy life cycle have impacts on the natural environment. Because of this 
close connection, the EPA has a broad range of energy-related interests. The agency has many 
programs and regulations that deal with fossil energy sources and their residuals, such as coal 
mines and oil and gas operations. Similarly, EPA regulates emissions and effluents from fossil 
energy conversion and consumption facilities and operations, including power plants and 
transportation vehicles. EPA’s attempts to address greenhouse gas emissions and global climate 
change issues emphasize carbon dioxide sources from the use of coal and oil and gas.  


189 Our Mission and What We Do. Online. Available: http://www2.epa.gov/aboutepa/our-mission-and-what-we-do/. 


EPA’s energy efficiency programs seek to reduce pollution by decreasing energy consumption. 

Many of the EPA’s efforts and initiatives fall within the Agency’s Clean Energy Programs, 
which “are designed to help energy consumers in all sectors, state policy makers and energy 
providers improve their knowledge about Clean Energy technology and policy options…
” 
These programs include the following: 


1. Combined Heat and Power Partnership 

2. Green Power Partnership 

3. State and Local Climate and Energy Program 

4. National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency 

5. ENERGY STAR (joint program with the DOE) 

6. Center for Corporate Climate Leadership 

In summary, a major portion of EPA’s pollution control and abatement activities deal with 
energy sources and their environmental residuals. These activities include regulation of energy 
facilities and reduction of energy use.  Support for and realization of emerging technologies are 
essential for EPA to accomplish its mission – both for clean energy sources and for mitigating 
impacts of existing sources.

4 Government-Supported Research Entities 

Two additional entities, the National Science Foundation and the National Academies of 
Science, Engineering and Medicine, play a strong role in developing emerging energy 
technologies. 

National Science Foundation (NSF) 
As a premier national agency for advancing scientific research, the National Science Foundation 
(NS) has a strong role in discovering and developing scientific discoveries and technology for 
new sources of energy. NSF's vision is “a Nation that creates and exploits new concepts in 
science and engineering and provides global leadership in research and education”
. Its mission 
“was established by Congress in legislation that created the agency. The NSF Act of 1950 
(Public Law 81-507) sets forth the mission: “to promote the progress of science; to advance the 
national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other 
purposes.”
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency that supports 
fundamental research at the frontiers of knowledge, across all fields of science and engineering 
(S&E), and S&E education. It is the only federal agency whose mission includes support for all 
fields of fundamental science and technology, except for medical sciences
. NSF has three 
Strategic Goals: 1) transform the frontiers of science and engineering; 2) stimulate innovation 
and address societal needs through research and education; and 3) excel as a Federal Science 
Agency. The first two goals illustrate the two main components of NSF’s mission – advancing 
the progress of science while benefitting the Nation, and they indicate the primary means by 
which NSF ensures the preeminence of U.S. research and development. Each of the three goals is

expanded with two to three Strategic Objectives. The NSF has seven directorates and two 
program offices:  
− Biological Sciences 
− Computer and Information Science and Engineering 
− Education and Human Resources 
− Engineering 
− Geosciences 
− Mathematical and Physical Sciences 
− Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences 
− Office of International Science and Engineering 
− Office of Integrative Activities 
Unlike many agencies that conduct research internally, the NSF does not operate its own labs, 
but instead provides funds for support of other research entities. It is an independent agency that 
does not fall under any of the President’s Cabinet entities. 

Energy-related research comprises a critical element for achieving NSF’s mission, goals, and 
strategies. Energy is critical to the nation’s health, prosperity, and welfare. Energy research is an 
essential component of achieving science and engineering advances (Strategic Objective 1- 
Invest in fundamental research to ensure significant continuing advances across science, 
engineering, and education – of Strategic Goal 1) and providing world-class research 
infrastructure (Strategic Objective 3 – Provide world-class research infrastructure to enable 
major scientific advances – of Strategic Goal 1). Energy must also be included in efforts to 
connect fundamental research to meeting society’s needs (Strategic Objective 1 – Strengthen the 
links between fundamental research and societal needs through investments and partnerships – of 
Strategic Goal 2. NSF supports research to “catalyze breakthroughs in national priorities 
including clean energy, robotics, nanotechnology, and cyber security”
Clearly, research and development support for emerging energy technologies is essential for NSF 
to accomplish its mission and realize its Strategic Goals.

National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine 
The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine ("Academies") have a long 
tradition of developing the basis for making policy for scientific research and technology 
development. The Academies are therefore well positioned to facilitate development of new and 
emerging energy technologies as well as deal with their impacts on society and the natural 
environment. They are “private, nonprofit institutions that provide expert advice on some of the 
most pressing challenges facing the nation and the world.”
 The Academies are “the nation's 
pre-eminent source of high-quality, objective advice on science, engineering, and health 
matters.” 
Although the Academies were founded by the U.S. Government, they are a private entity that 
seeks to provide advice in its three areas using nationally (and internationally) recognized 
experts. Membership is by invitation of current members, and advisory services are provided 
without compensation. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS), National Academy of 
Engineering (NAE), and Institute of Medicine (precursor to the NIM) were founded in 1863, 
1964, and 1975, respectively. The Academies reorganized in 2015 when the NIM changed its 
name. The National Research Council (founded in 1916), which had been the working arm of the 
Academies, became the Working Units of the Academies in the reorganization.  

The Academies’ work “helps shape sound policies, inform public opinion, and advance the 
pursuit of science, engineering, and medicine.”
 Most of the work is performed under seven 
major programs:  
− Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education 
− Earth and Life Studies 
− Engineering and Physical Sciences 
− Institute of Medicine 
− Policy and Global Affairs 
− Transportation Research Board 
− NAS Gulf Research Program

196 Who We Are. Online. Available: http://www.nationalacademies.org/about/whoweare/. 


The mission of the Program Units (former National Research Council) is “to improve 
government decision making and public policy, increase public understanding, and promote the 
acquisition and dissemination of knowledge in matters involving science, engineering, 
technology, and health.”
About 85% of the Academies’ work is funded by agencies of the U.S. Government, and the 
remainder by state and local governments, foundations, and nonprofit authorities
. About 200 
reports are produced each year.
 The Academies’ 2014 report to Congress addressed five areas 
in Natural Resources and the Environment


1. The Gulf Research Program 

2. Responding to Oil Spills in the U.S. Arctic Marine Environment 

3. Progress Toward Restoring the Everglades 

4. Reducing Coastal Risk on the East and Gulf Coasts 

5. Reducing the Fuel Consumption and Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Medium- and 

Heavy-Duty Vehicles 
Much of the energy-related work of the Academies is performed by the Board on Energy and 
Environmental Systems (BEES), which is in the Division on Engineering and Physical Systems 
(DEPS). BEES “conducts a program of studies and other activities to provide independent advice 
to the executive and legislative branches of government and the private sector on issues in 
energy and environmental technology, and related public policy.”
. BEES directs expert 
attention to a number of energy topics: 


1. Energy supply and demand technologies and systems, including resource extraction 

through mining and drilling, energy conversion, distribution and delivery, and 
efficiency of use 


2. Environmental consequences of energy related activities

3. Environmental systems and controls in areas related to fuels production, energy 

conversion, transmission, and use 


4. Related issues in national security and defense 

A major BEES initiative, America’s Energy Future (AEF), was started in 2007 “to provide an 
authoritative analysis of technology options and their costs and impacts to help make sensible 
decisions about the nation’s energy future”
. The tasks of the AEF were to: 
− Review the portfolio of recently completed major studies on energy use and 
technology’s potential for improvement and compare their assumptions 
− Analyze the currency and quality of information used 
− Assess the relative state of maturity of technologies for potential deployment in the 
next decade to reduce U.S. dependence on oil imports and CO2 emissions while 
ensuring that affordable energy is available to sustain economic growth. 

Key findings of the AEF report addressed the following topics
Technology Deployment Options 
Energy Savings from Improved Efficiency 
Options for Increasing Electricity Supplies and Changing the Supply Mix 
Modernizing the Nation’s Power Grid 
Continued Dependence on Petroleum 
Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
Technology Research, Development, and Demonstration 
Barriers to Accelerated Technology Deployment 
The Academies have also been deeply involved in global climate change issues. In response to 
Congress’ legislation, “a series of coordinated activities designed to advance the U.S. response to 
climate change” has been conducted starting in 2009
. These activities are intended to build on 
an extensive foundation of previous and ongoing work, tap experts and stakeholders from a 
range of communities (academia, business, government, NGOs, international), analyze options

and strategies for dealing with climate change issues, assess short-term and long-term strategies 
and investments (as well as impediments and needed advances), and produce reports that provide 
advice to decision makers. A number of GCC-related reports have been prepared covering, for 
example, the following topics
Climate Stabilization Targets 
Abrupt Climate Changes 
Sea Level Rise 
Adaptation to Impacts 
Climate Modeling 
Social Stress 
Arctic Issues 
Alternative Vehicles and Fuels 
National Security Implications 
Tax Policy on Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
Current studies address extreme weather events, landscape conservation, seasonal and 
subseasonal forecasting, and advisory service for research on global change.  

Investigation of emerging energy technologies and realizing their benefits – as well as dealing 
with their secondary impacts – are essential to the Academies to achieve their purpose.

sites.org/americasclimatechoices/other-reports-on-climate-change/. 


5 Other Agencies 

Several additional agencies have potential interest in energy issues. However, they are not as 
salient for the LENR case because emerging energy technologies are not essential to 
accomplishing their missions or because LENR does not appear to be the type of technology in 
the profile of their responsibilities. These agencies include the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, Energy Information Administration, National Energy Technology Laboratory, and 
member entities of the Intelligence Community, including the Director of National Intelligence, 
Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and Intelligence Advanced Research 
Project Activity. 

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is an independent federal agency that 
regulates the interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas, and oil. FERC also reviews 
proposals to build liquefied natural gas terminals and interstate natural gas pipelines as well as 
licensing hydropower projects
. It was created in 1977 when its predecessor, the Federal Power 
Commission, was abolished and most of its regulatory mission was inherited by FERC
FERC's mission is to "assist consumers in obtaining reliable, efficient, and sustainable energy 
services at a reasonable cost through appropriate regulatory and market means"
. The agency 
lists five guiding principles: organizational excellence, due process and transparency, regulatory 
certainty, stakeholder involvement, and timeliness
. The strategic plan includes four goals 
(each of which has two to three specific objectives): ensure just and reasonable rates, terms and 
conditions; promote safe, reliable, secure, and efficient infrastructure; and mission support

through organizational excellence
. FERC is led by four Commissioners (only three of which 
can be from a single political party) and has three main internal functions: regulatory, litigation, 
and administration, each of which consists of three or more Offices
FERC's responsibilities are primarily regulatory in nature and are focused on conventional 
energy sources. Although the agency may address emerging energy technologies in the future as 
they contribute substantially to the nation's energy supply, it does not appear to be significantly 
involved in their development or in dealing with their secondary impacts.  

U.S. DOE Energy Information Administration (EIA) 
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) is the statistical and analytical agency within the 
U.S. Department of Energy
. The agency was created in 1977 as a successor to the Federal 
Energy Administration. It was set up with independence from other DOE components as well as 
other government entities
. Its mission is to “collect, analyze, and disseminate independent and 
impartial energy information to promote sound policymaking, efficient markets, and public 
understanding of energy and its interaction with the economy and the environment”
. The 
agency’s strategic plan sets forth four goals: transform data operations, increase analytical 
impact, improve the customer experience, and enable the mission:
." Its values are to deliver 
results, apply rigor, play as a team and character counts. The agency has an Administrator and is 
organized into four main areas, each headed by an Assistant Administrator
: Energy Statistics, 
Energy Analysis, Communications, and Resource and Technology Management. The EIA 
produces periodic reports (daily to annually) primarily on conventional energy sources, including 
oil, refined products, natural gas, coal, and electricity

Emerging energy technologies do not appear to be addressed specifically by the EIA. Also, the 
agency collects energy information rather than supporting or developing new or emerging 
sources or dealing with their secondary impacts.  

U.S. DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) 
The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is a U.S. DOE national laboratory that 
supports the DOE mission to advance the energy security of the U.S. 
. It is the only national 
lab that is owned and operated by DOE
. Its history goes back to 1910, when its predecessor, 
the U.S. Bureau of Mines, was established
. NETL’s mission is to "discover, integrate, and 


220 221

mature technology solutions to enhance the nation's energy foundation and protect the 
environment for future generations"
. The agency’s vision is to "be the nation's renowned 
fossil-energy science and engineering resource, delivering world-class technology solutions 
today and tomorrow." The agency is organized into four primary Centers – Research & 
Innovation, Technology Development Integration (these two are under Science & Technology 
Solutions Plans & Programs), Laboratory Operations, and Finance & Acquisition
. NETL's six 
core competencies help address national energy challenges and include the following
− Computational Sciences & Engineering 
− Materials Engineering & Manufacturing 
− Geological & Environmental Systems 
− Energy Conversion Engineering 
− Systems Engineering & Analysis 
− Program Evaluation & Integration

The laboratory maintains a focus on fossil fuels. It contributes to U.S. DOE strategic goals 
“through cutting-edge research and development focused on efficient energy use and clean 
energy production from our nation’s domestic fossil fuel resources” 
Although NETL pursues emerging energy technologies, they are primarily related to fossil 
energy sources. LENR therefore may not be able to help NETL to accomplish its mission as 
much as it can for other agencies. NETL performs work for EERE, but LENR opportunities in 
helping agencies meet their requirements are likely to be with EERE directly. 

U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) 
That IC includes 17 agencies and other entities in the Executive Branch that work independently 
and collaboratively to meet the nation's intelligence needs with respect to national security and 
foreign relations
. It was formed by executive order in 1981, but came into prominence with 
the passage of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) in 2004
IRTPA, which was enacted as a result of the 9/11 act of terrorism, reorganized the configuration 
of multiple intelligence organizations. The IC strives to exhibit three characteristics that are 
essential to its effectiveness – integration, agility, and exemplifying American values
. These 
values are protection of privacy, report respecting human rights, and retaining the trust of the 
American people. Six basic sources are used in the IC
− Signal Intelligence 
− Imagery Intelligence 
− Measurement and Signatures Intelligence 
− Human Intelligence 
− Open Source Intelligence 
− Geospatial Intelligence

− National Counterpoliferation Center (NCPC) 
− National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) 
− Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center (CTIIC) 
The ODNI also includes the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) and the 
National Intelligence Council. 

The mission and goals of the DNI do not address energy topics or emerging energy technologies 
specifically, so LENR may not have opportunities to help the DNI meet its responsibilities. 

Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
The CIA traces its roots to the use of intelligence in the early days of the U.S. 
  It's forerunner 
was the Office of Strategic Services, which functioned during World War II but was abolished at 
the end of the war. The CIA was established when the National Security Act was signed by 
President Truman in 1947
. A number of changes occurred at the CIA when IRTPA was passed 
in 2004
. In particular, the role of the CIA Director as coordinator of the nation's intelligence 
activities was transferred to the DNI, and the CIA Director was focused on the agency itself. 

The CIA gathers foreign (not domestic) intelligence for the benefit of senior U.S. 
policymakers
, particularly the President. The CIA's mission is to "preempt threats and further 
U.S. national security objectives by collecting intelligence that matters, producing objective all-
source analysis, conducting effective covert action as directed by the president, and safeguarding 
the secrets that help keep our Nation safe
". Its vision is that the "CIA's information, insights, 
and actions consistently provide tactical and strategic advantage to the US". 257. CIA's officers 
are guided by a professional ethos "that is the some of the agency's abiding principles, core

values, and highest aspirations
": service, integrity, excellence, courage, teamwork, and 
stewardship. Two of the agency's principle challenges identified by the Director are ungoverned 
spaces and the digital revolution
Besides the Office of the Director, the CIA is organized into 5 Directorates, 10 Mission Centers, 


14 Enterprise Functions, and 10 elements of the Talent Center of Excellence

. The five 
Directorates are Analysis, Digital Innovation, Operations, Science and Technology, and Support. 

The Directorates carry out "the intelligence cycle" of collecting, analyzing, and disseminating 
intelligence information to U.S. Government officials
. The Mission Centers were the result of 
CIA modernization. Six of the centers focus on regions of the world, and four focus on 
functional issues such as counter terrorism and counter proliferation
. The CIA conducts covert 
actions at the direction of the President, usually upon the recommendation of the National 
Security Council. 

Examination of the mission and organization of the CIA does not indicate a particular emphasis 
on energy issues or on emerging energy technologies specifically. LENR may therefore not have 
significant opportunity to help the CIA accomplish its mission at this time. However, should 
LENR become an issue of national security, such as if it is a achieved in a nation that is an 
adversary of the US, LENR may become important to the CIA's mission in the future. 

Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) 
The DIA is a DoD combat support agency that is a major provider and manager of foreign 
military intelligence. It provides military intelligence to warfighters, defense policymakers and 
force planners, in the DoD and the IC, in support of U.S. military planning and operations and 
weapon systems acquisition
. The agency was established by Secretary of Defense Robert

McNamara (under President John Kennedy) in 1961
. Its mission is to “provide intelligence on 
foreign militaries and operating environments that delivers decision advantage to prevent and 
decisively win wars”, and its vision is to “be the indispensable source of defense intelligence 
expertise”
. Both the DIA and CIA are members of the IC, but the DIA is a principal source of 
foreign intelligence to combat-related missions, whereas the CIA is focused on providing 
intelligence to the President and his Cabinet
DIA has developed a strategy that sets forth five primary lines of effort: leadership and 
workforce, integrated intelligence, enterprise governance, information and technology, and 
mission capability security
. The agency is organized into four Directorates (Analysis, 
Operations Science and Technology, and Mission Services) and four Intelligence Centers: 
Americas, Asia/Pacific, Europe/Eurasia, and Middle East/Africa
Like the CIA, the DIA does not now appear to emphasize energy-related topics or, specifically, 
emerging energy technologies. LENR may therefore not be able to help the DIA accomplish its 
mission unless the new energy were to become a technological threat to the defense of the US. 

That the DIA continues to monitor the status of LENR in the national security context is 
confirmed by a report issued in 2009
Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) 
IARPA was established in the Office in 2006 with a mandate to conduct cross-community 
research, target new opportunities and innovation, and generate revolutionary capabilities
. It is

the IC, and the results from its programs are expected to transition to its IC customers
IARPA’s mission is to invest in high-risk, high-payoff research programs to tackle some of the 
most difficult challenges of the agencies and disciplines of the IC
The Activity was modeled after DARPA when it was created, and, like DARPA, it utilizes the 
topics of the Heilmeier Questions for high-level guidance
: what is going to be done, how it is 
presently done and by whom, limitations of present approaches, what’s new in the proposed 
approach and why it can be successful, what difference success will make, time required and 
cost, and mid-term and final exams. The Activity is organized into four cutting-edge Offices: 
Anticipatory Surprise, Incisive Analysis, Safe and Secure Operations, and Smart Collection
Current Research Areas include computer vision, big data, multilingual speech recognition, 
satellite image processing, machine learning, geospatial fusion, artificial intelligence, and pattern 
recognition
. During 2016 IARPA launched 12 new multi-year research programs and had over 


250 peer-reviewed publications from its funded research

IARPA's research trusts and areas of current research do not appear to emphasize energy topics 
or emerging energy technologies. However, to the extent that LENR could provide an energy 
source for IARPA-developed devices, it could in the future potentially contribute to the 
Activity's accomplishing its mission.

6 Summary 

Emerging energy technologies are increasing in importance as the world's demand for energy 
increases and as current energy sources become more problematic. LENR is a potential but 
controversial new energy technology that was rejected when it was introduced in 1989. 

However, it has continued to be a subject of research and development, so that its prospects 
appear to have improved considerably. 

Many U.S. Government agencies have energy policy responsibilities. Some 30 agencies have 
been reviewed for their energy-related interests, with emphasis on emerging energy technologies. 

This review included for each agency its overall mission, background and organization, energy 
responsibilities, and realization of new technologies as well as addressing their secondary 
impacts. Emerging energy technologies play a vital role in most of the agencies reviewed in 
accomplishing their mission. As a promising new energy technology, LENR may help these 
agencies to meet their responsibilities.
