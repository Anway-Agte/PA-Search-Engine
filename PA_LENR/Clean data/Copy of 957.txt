1. Introduction

Most of the Cold Fusion experimental work has been carried out without
paying much attention to the physicochemical properties of the metal matrix. as they
were usually run with commercial samples. However, the purity and structural
properties of the matrix sample have a strong effect on its hydrogenation/deuteration
behavior1,2. For example, gaseous impurities can reduce the maximum hydrogen
uptake and influence the mobility of the hydrogen atoms. Therefore, we think that the
lack of reproducibility in Cold Fusion experiments could be related to some non
controlled characteristic of the metal matrix, as was evidenced by the dependence of
reported results on the commercial batch production number3. Considering this scene,
we have been working on the production of very pure titanium films of wellcontrolled characteristics to be used in Cold Fusion experiments.


2.Film Growth and Characterization.

Titanium films were grown by a modified Iodide Process. This technique is
based on the thermal decomposition of Til<1 vapors according to the overall reaction
Til4 +-+ Ti +4I. Its major success comes from the fact that the obtained material is
nearly free of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon, as these gases do not react with iodine.

In our experimental system, a ·flow of iodide vapors is passed over a tungsten
ribbon filament ( 40x2x0.025 mm) electrically heated up to 1100-1500 °C and located
in a Pyrex glass chamber. The quantity of titanium deposited mass is monitored on
line by accurate measurements of the electrical resistance variations of the filament.
The obtained samples have an average titanium mass of 60 mg to reach a final
thickness about 200 µm. The films can be deposited at distinct filament temperatures
and mass deposition rates, by suitable adjustment of the electrical current and TiI4
vapor pressure. When the titanium deposition is finished, the filament chamber is
sealed off. Thus, residual iodine and TiI4 arc taken away and the film is never exposed
to the external atmosphere avoiding its superficial oxidation. A more detailed
information about the sample preparation system is given clsewhere4.

The obtained films were analyzed by EDAX (energy-dispersive analysis of Xrays) and XRD (X-Ray diffraction), and observed by SEM (scanning electron
microscopy). Its hydrogenation behavior was also studied in an external system5
,6. The main feature yielded by these analyses is the strong diffusion of the tungsten
substrate into the deposited titanium films depending on the growth rate and
temperature . Due to the tungsten diffusion the obtained films exhibit special
physicochemical characteristics compared to pure titanium. It was determined by
XRD that the high temperature crystallographic structure of titanium W-titanium
phase, BCC) is stabilized when tungsten exceeds a certain concentration ( ~8 at%)
whereas the common a-phase (HCP) is presented when tungsteri concentration is
lower than this value. In relation to their hydrogenation behavior, a large hysteresis
effect was observed in the �-8 plateau of the P-X diagram that increases as tungsten
diffusion does. However, the hydrogenation kinetics of the films does not differ much
from pure titanium as the diffusion coefficients of hydrogen in these films have been
found to be, at most, an order of magnitude lower than that for pure titanium.

Finally, it is worthy to comment that the titanium deposition rate has also a
significant influence on the morphological characteristics of the films. Slow
deposition rates produce a very compact bulk structure and high crystallinity, while
fast deposition rates can even develop macroscopically cavities inside the films. 


3.Cold Fusion experimental setup and features.

Once the film has been grown, the filament chamber is joined to the "Cold
Fusion" experimental setup, which is sketched in figure 1. Three different parts can
be distinguished in this arrangement: the hydrogenation line, the neutron detection
system, and the electrical control system of the sample.

The hydrogenation line, constructed in S.S (316) and Pyrex glass, behaves as a
Sieverts type apparatus. The entire system can be evacuated to 10-6 torr by means of a
turbomolecular pump and it is equipped with Pirani, Penning and Piezoresistive
gauges and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Balzers QMG 064). In the Pyrex line, a
magnetic striker is located to open the filament chamber after the system is evacuated. 
Several valves allow the entry of hydrogen or deuterium in the chamber by doses. 

The neutron detection system comprises two liquid scintillator detectors: a 
BC501, properly shielded with a 10 cm thick wall of Pb, and a NE2 l 3. Far from the 
experiment, we have installed a Br3 detector (22020 Alnor) to monitor possible
variations of the neutron background. For the sample-detectors configuration our 
neutron detection efficiency is equal to 0.5%. Neutron energy and time spectra are 
eventually monitored in different MCA (Canberra). 

The electrical control of the filament allows to pass an electrical DC current 
through the film while two tungsten wires (25 µm OD), welded at its edges, serve as 
two probes for determining the voltage drop in the film. This configuration constitutes 
a four probe system. The electrical current is applied by a DC power supply 
(Keenwood 2036D) which is operated manually or controlled by a function generator. 

In addition, an electrically heated furnace or a liquid nitrogen container can be placed 
around the filament chamber to attain temperatures from -196 to 300°C. All the 
electrical and pressure parameters are finally monitored by a PC. 

Figure 1. Sketch of the "Cold Fusion" setup. 

This experimental system provides very interesting new highlights. Electrical 
currents up to 12 A can be passed through the sample that is heated up, in this way, to 
l 500°C. When using the external liquid nitrogen container, sample temperature is
cooled down, at least, at -l 00°C. Hydrogen uptake is measured by the drop of the
hydrogen pressure and is correlated with filament resistance variations. Besides,
absorption and desorption cycles can be done under controlled rates by electrical
heating of the samples. Nevertheless, as an electrical current can be passed through the
sample during its hydrogenation, this system resembles an electrochemical Cold 
Fusion experiment. This fact probably constitutes the principal highlight of this 
arrangement. In addition, hydrogen/deuterium diffusion coefficient can be made very 
similar to those attained in the Pd hydrogenation in electrochemical cells, by heating 
the Ti samples at 3OO-5OO°C. Furthermore, both 0-Palladium hydride and 0-Titaniurn 
hydride present the same crystallographic structure (FCC) at these circumstances. 

Considering the well-known physicochemical properties of the films described 
before it will be able to relate the possible nuclear reactions with their characteristics. 
In addition, it should be remarked that the presence of the tungsten substrate will 
proportionate good mechanical strength to the film during loading-unloading 
hydrogenation cycles as tungsten does not absorb appreciably hydrogen. 


4. Summary

A novel experimental system for the production of titanium samples has been 
developed and it can be adapted to Cold Fusion experiments. This system provides a 
good control of the physicochemical properties of the metal matrix and produces films 
with low content of gaseous impurities even at a superficial level. A wide field of Cold 
Fusion experiments in the gas phase can be run with the described setup and, under 
certain circumstances, deuterium loading can be done in a very similar way to that 
used in electrochemical cells by applying electrical current to the films. We feel that 
all this scheme will help to obtain interesting and reproducible results in the very next 
future.
