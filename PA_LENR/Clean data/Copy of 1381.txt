1. Introduction

Let us start with a brief description of phenomena of sono-luminescence. A supersonic field applied to a liquid yields vapour- and/or gas-filled cavitations in the liquid, which
subsequently expand and contract more or less oscillatorilly in phase with the supersonic field.
The temperature and density of an adiabatically compressed bubble is so high that atoms or
molecules in it are excited and then irradiate photons in its expansion phase.

Recently Flint and Suslick1) succeeded in directly measuring the temperature of hot
spots and obtained the value

T = 5075 ± 156K.

The aim of this work is to estimate the upper bound of the temperature and density of the
hot spot created in a liquid by a supersonic field.


2. Rayleigh-Plesset Equation

The sono-luminescence has a long history of research more than forty-five years and
constitutes a well-established branch of physics. We now have a lot of review works, by which
one may easily get familiar with it. (For example, see Reference 2)

The motion of a bubble in a liquid with radius R is described by the followinf
Rayleigh-Plesset equation

[ 20- Ro 3
" 20- 4µR ] R=--R +- (Po+-)(-) -----Po -PA(t), 2R {!R Ro R R R (1) 

where Po is a hydrostatic pressure of the liquid and Ro is a radius of the bubble in equilibrium
with the pressure P0• The {!, a and J.L are, respectively, the density, surface tension and viscosity
coefficient of the liquid. The K is the polytropic index of the gas (this will vary between the
specific heat ratio -y and unity, the limits of adiabatic and isothermal conditions, respectively).
It is assumed in ( 1) that the content of the bubble is an ideal gas, but generalization to a van
der Waals gas may be straight-forward. The PA (t) is the applied supersonic field

P(A)(t) = -PasinwAT. (2)

In deriving (1), several simplification were made. (For details, see Reference 2) 


3. An Ideal Gas Case

Let us consider a bubble with radius R0 and in equilibrium with hydrostatic pressure
Po at t = 0, which will then expand isothermally in the first quarter of a period of the
supersonic field (2). If the amplitude PA of the field is large enough, the radius of the bubble
is known to abnormally grow up beyond the Blake radius RD 2
>. Let the maximum value of
the radius R be Rmax. In a subsequent half period, the pressure field increases from Po -PA to
Po + PA and the bubble contracts adiabatically with increasing pressure. Let Rm,n be a radius
of the minimum bubble, where the gas filling the bubble achieves the maximum temperature Tmax.

The expansion phase is describable in terms of (1) by putting K = 1 (isothermal
proccess), since the poccess takes place quasistatically. Neppiras 3
) numerically calculated the Rmax for an air bubble in water, assuming that the air is an ideal gas.

Next turn to the contraction phase. It was numerically ascertained by many authors
that the contraction occurs very rapidly around the end of the third quarter of a period of the
supersonic field (2), when the pressure field is almost Po+ PA . We can thereby describe the
adiabatic contraction proccess by a couple of following equations

(Po+ PA)(Vmax - Vm,n) = - f v=,� PdV,
V=•• (3)
PV'i' = constant

in stead of directly solving the differential equation (1).

After integrating (3), we can get the maximum temperature and minimum radius as
follows;

z = ( Rmax )3 ~ [(-r _ l
) Po + PA (
Rma
:r )3
] 1/(1-1)
Rm;,. Po + 2a-/ Ro Ro
( 4)

if Z is much greater·than unity, where To is the initial temperature. Figs. l(a) and l(b) depict
R.,.;,. and Tma:r: against Ro, where we have used values of Rmax calculated by Neppiras. 

Figure 1 (a) (b)

As seen from Fig. l(b ), for initial bubbles of a few microns the maximum temperatures
reached are high enough for nudear fusion to take place. Let the bubble be filled by D2 gas
instead of air. The fusion number per bubble can be calculates as

No. of fusions/sec/bubble= fT (N,/N)2 N {!vu(E), (5)

where fT is the fraction of the duration of a minimum bubble to the period of the supersonic
field, and N and N, are the numbers of particles contained in the initial bubble and remaining
in the minimum bubble, respectively. The rest of factors on the right hand side of (5)

NgvCT(E) (6)

is a so-called fusion rate per bubble, where {!, v and CT(E) are the number density of gas in
the minimum bubble, averaged relative velocity of gas constituents and fusion cross section,
respectively. In (6), E = (1/2)µv2 = (3/2)kDTmax, where µ is the reduced mass, kn the
Boltzmann constant. In deriving (5), we postulate that the fusion reaction takes place as
in free space, neglecting the dynamical correlation among deuterons, dynamical screening of
Coulomb repulsion by electrons etc. We can roughly estimate fr and the fraction N0 /N as
follows. The speed of wall of the bubble in the contraction phase may be close to the sound
velocity v,. The duration of the minimum bubble, therefore, may be roughly estimated as
Rm;,./v,. On the other hand, the speed of diffusion of the gas content to the liquid is much
smaller than that of the wall, so that we may put N0 /N ~ 1. The fusion rate per bubble (5)
are plotted against Ro in Fig. 2.

Figure 2

After all, we get a sufficient number of fusions easily detectable in a laboratory.


4. Discussion

Calculations so far made concerns a perfect gas and it is questionable whether such
an idealization is valid up to extreme conditions that we are now interested in. To obtain
quantitatively acceptable results, we have at least to carrry out calculation similar to the
above for a van der Waals gas, and eventually apply molecular dynamics, plasma physics etc.
This work only constitutes a preliminary part of the whole task and detailed calculation will
appear in another place.
