I. Introduction

There appears to be a general expectation that the
occurrence of "cold fusion" phenomena, if any, is connected to
some unusual and hitherto unknown behaviors of hydrogen in
metals, especially in Pd. The purpose of this paper is to
describe some basic properties of the hydrogen-metal system,
the ABC's, the knowledge of which must be shared by everyone
in this community. (For more details including most recent
results, see Fukai 1993).

Roughly speaking, there are two ways for nuclear fusion
to take place. The first, the ordinary way, is that the fusion
occurs in the course of collision of two nuclei having energies
high enough to overcome the mutual Coulomb repulsion. The
second is that two nuclei are held at sufficiently short distances
so that the nuclear fusion can be induced by the tunneling
through the Coulomb barrier. As by definition the real "cold"
fusion refers to the second (static) mechanism, most of the
discussions given below are on the equilibrium properties of
the hydrogen-metal system, more specifically, the state of D-D
pairs in metals. Only a brief description will be given of some
properties that are relevant to dynamical processes.

A measure of the internuclear distance that produces
observable fusion rates is given by the calculation of Koonin
and Nauenberg (1989). They calculated fusion rates in
diatomic hydrogen molecules of various isotopic composition,
and their dependence on the internuclear distance by varying
the hypothetical electron mass. Their results showed that the
fusion rate depends nearly exponentially on the distance, and
that for the d-d fusion rate to be 10-20 s-1, the distance should
be -0.015nm. The question is whether there is any way to
hold D-D pairs in metals at such a short distance. For
comparison, at the distance of a D2 molecule (0.074nm), the
fusion rate amounts to only I0-64 s-1, which is completely
negligible.


2. Distance between hydrogen atoms in metals
Hydrogen atoms enter interstitial sites in metal lattices to
form metallic alloys. The heat of solution h8 is different for
different metal species, and for a given metal, varies with the
hydrogen concentration as shown in Fig. l (Fukai 1993). In all
the cases, the concentration dependence of h8 is similar. The

overall lattice expansion caused by hydrogen atoms facilitates
the dissolution of hydrogen at the beginning, but the shortrange repulsion between hydrogen atoms gradually comes into
play at higher concentrations.

In Pd, the heat of solution is hs = -0.106 eV at the infinite
dilution, but it crosses zero at x = [H]/[Pd] "' 0.84, and becomes
positive thereafter (Flanagan and Lynch 1975). This implies
that near the composition x "' 0.84, there can be large
concentration fluctuations in the hydriding process (e.g. by
electrolysis), and at higher concentrations, PdHx decomposes
exothermically (by giving off heat). For D in Pd, the heat-ofsolution curve is shifted by 0.026 eV upward (Wicke 1985),
but the overall behavior is nearly the same.

There is an empirical rule that interstitial hydrogen
atoms do not come closer than 0.21 nm, another manifestation
of the short-range mutual repulsion. In cases where the
distance between neighboring interstitial sites is shorter than
0.21 nm interstitial sites are only partially filled with
hydrogens, either orderly or disorderly.

Maps showing the average D-density distribution can be
Fourier-reconstructed from neutron diffraction data. Care must
be taken in interpreting the density maps in disordered phases:
whereas the maps indicate that hydrogens are distributed
evenly over all the closely-spaced interstitial sites, the actual
situation should be that they occupy only a small fraction of
sites by trying to keep away from each other. In ordered
phases, on the other hand, D-density maps provide useful
information on the potential field for hydrogen atoms. Figure 2
shows D-density maps of B-VDo.51, an ordered phase of the V-D
system (Okada 1980). The distribution of D atoms is very
strongly anisotropic, indicating that the potential is steeply
increasing in the c-direction and is slowly-varying in the a-b
direction. The amplitude of potential undulations can be
estimated from the excitation energies to highly excited
vibrational states (observed by inelastic neutron scattering)
and the activation energies of diffusion at high temperatures
where the migration proceeds essentially via jumps over
saddle points (Fukai and Sugimoto 1992, Fukai 1993 ). Thus, a
measure of potential undulations can be given as 0.5-leV.

!3-VDo.s 1 (Okada 1980). 

A possibility of hydrogen atoms coming a little closer
arises when they are trapped by lattice defects, more
specifically, by vacancies. Numerous experiments performed
on the defect-trapping of hydrogen atoms have shown that in
many metals a vacancy can trap as many as six hydrogen
atoms with binding energies of the order of -0.5 eV (Myers et
al. 1989). This does not imply that six hydrogen atoms are
jammed in a very narrow space by replacing one metal atom.
Rather, it is more appropriate to regard them as occupying six
interstitial sites nearest to the vacancy. The actual
configuration of D trapped by vacancies in Pd determined by
the channeling method is depicted in Fig. 3 (Besenbacher et al.
1990). Hydrogen atoms are displaced slightly towards the

atoms trapped at a vacancy

1989). 

center of a vacancy, and the mutual distance between them
("' 0.185mn) is certainly smaller than the normal distance in a
stoichiometric PdD ("' 0.28nm). Recently, a number of
calculations have been performed on the electronic structure
and energies of hydrogen pairs in Pd (Wang et al. 1989, Sun
and Tomanek 1989, Lam and Yu J 989), and all the calculations
agree in that the equilibrium pair distance becomes longer than
the internuclear separation in a molecule.


3. Possibility of close D-D pairs in metals

It may be appropriate here to specify more clearly the
requirement to be placed on the 0-D distance. The ordinary
procedure to calculate the fusion rate /\ is to evaluate the wave
function of the relative motion of two D nuclei at the separation
of p~I0-14 m, where nuclear interactions occur; viz. /\=Al'I'(p)l2.
This procedure is not applicable to a D-D pair in a metal
because the potential field arising from interactions with metal
atoms is fixed in position relative to the metal lattice, and
therefore the separation of space variables into the center-ofmass and the relative coordinate cannot be made. However,
the following considerations show that potential undulations in
metals do not affect the problem seriously.

At small pair separations, the interaction potential can be
written in any case as

V(r) --. e2/r + V0• (1)

In a free space, the electronic energy is that of the He atom,
V0 = -51.8 eV. The calculation of Koonin and Nauenberg
( 1989) which correctly incorporated this screening energy gave
the D-D fusion rate ten orders of magnitude larger than the
previous calculation which neglected this term (V0 = 0) (Van
Siclen and Jones 1986). Judging from these results, the effect
of potential undulations in metals, being only 0.5~1 eV, should
not change the order of magnitude of the Koonin-Nauenberg's
calculation. Thus, the requirement on the pair separation of
-0.015nm applies equally well to D-D pairs in metals.

The following discussions show that there is no way to
sustain such close D-D pairs in any solids. 

Let us consider the balance of forces exerted by the
repulsion between two D atoms in a pair and the counteracting
force arising from the distorted interatomic bonds of the
surrounding lattice.

The repulsive force is estimated as /p""e2/r2""lxl0-6N at
r"" 0. 015nm, whereas the lattice force per bond can be
estimated as fb "' (c u/N0) • (till!), where N0 is the number of
bonds per unit area. Substituting the values appropriate for Pd
(CJ J = 2.3 x 101 I N/m2, N0 = 6.6 x 1Q18 m-2) and for large strains
of lllll ~ 1/3, the counteracting force is estimated to be
.fb "' 1 x l 0-8 N at the largest. Thus, interatomic bonds in Pd
are not strong enough to counteract the forces exerted by the
close D-D pair. In fact, there is no solid on earth which is
strong enough to sustain D-D pairs at such short distances.
What actually happens is that the D:-D pair relaxes to a distance
where the force balance can be realized.

The same conclusion can be reached from energy
considerations. The energy of a D-D pair in a metal can be
approximated by the value in a free space; V(r) "'44.2 eV at
r "' 0.015nm. The electronic energy corrections in a metal
should be ~ l eV at the largest. On the other hand, formation
energies of lattice defects are much smaller; ~ 1.5 eV for a
vacancy and ~ 5 eV for an interstitial atom in a metal of a
melting point of Tm "' 2000K (these values roughly scale with
Tm). This implies that a close D-D pair, if once created, should
immediately transfer its energy to the surrounding lattice to
attain some lower-energy configuration; even the creation of a
number of lattice defects is energetically more favorable.

It may be added that the use of a screened Coulomb
potential (e2/r) e-a.r for the first term of eq.(1) is erroneous. A
literal application of a Thomas-Fermi formula which describes
the screening by a dense electron gas gives a screening length
of a-I = [4ne2N(Ep)J-112, which becomes as small as ~0.02nm in
Pd. This is a consequence of a peculiar situation in Pd that the
Fermi energy EF happens to fall on a very pronounced peak of
the density of states N(E). Calculations showed, however, that
this peak arises from 4d electrons of Pd which are strongly
localized on Pd atoms and therefore do not participate in the
screening of nuclear charges in interstitial sites
(Papaconstantopou\os et al. 1978). No such electrons are 
available in metals that are effective in screening a singlycharged particle in such vicinities.

The screening would be more effective if there were
negatively charged particles heavier than electrons. Indeed,
when an electron in a D2 molecule is replaced with a negative
muon (µ-) which is about 200 times heavier than an electron,
the screening radius is reduced by this factor and the fusion
prob ab iii ty is increased to 109 s- I. However, the use of the
"effective mass" of conduction electrons in this context is a
mistake. Conduction electrons behave as if they had a large
mass when they travel over many atomic distances as waves.
The concept of effective mass is simply inapplicable to the
problem of static charge screening.

The upper bound for a d-d fusion rate in metals was
calculated by Leggett and Baym ( 1989) by including possible
many body effects, and was found to be very small ( -10-47 s-1 ),
in agreement with the present discussions.

Thus, we cannot expect any measurable d-d fusion to
occur in metals as long as we stay within the static regime.
Needless to say, the probability of realizing a close D-D
pair configuration by thermal excitation is negligibly small,
being e-44.2eV/kT "" 10-770 at room temperature.


4. Effects of high pressure

Here I describe the pressure dependence of the distance
between hydrogen atoms in elemental hydrogen and in
hydrogen-metal systems.

Elemental hydrogen under normal pressure is an
aggregate of stable covalent molecules weakly bound with each
other by van der Waals interactions. Thus, the interatomic
distance within a molecule ("' 0.074 nm) is much shorter than
intermolecular distances, and a large compressibility of the
elemental hydrogen results from the compression of the latter.
In contrast, the pressure dependence of the former is very
peculiar. The frequency of the stretching vibration, which
reflects the bond strength in a molecule, increases with
pressure up to - 40 GPa but turns into a decrease thereafter.
The decrease goes through a discontinuity at - 150 GPa and
continues on to - 250 GPa where the sample becomes gradually
more· opaque (a phenomenon indicative of an electronic band 
closure which leads eventually to a semi-conductive or semimetallic state) (Hemley and Mao 1988, Mao and Hemley 1989).
These observations imply that as more electrons tend to
participate in the bonding between molecules at higher
pressures, the bonding within the molecules becomes weaker
and the interatomic distance correspondingly longer.
Theoretical calculations predict that the metallization of
hydrogen proceeds in two steps; a molecular crystal - an
intermediate metallic structure with a remnant molecular
bonding - monatomic metal (Brovman et al. 1972, Barbee et al.
1989). It is only after the monatomic metallic structure is
realized that the minimum distance between hydrogen atoms
decreases with pressure.

Fukai (1991) pointed out that the hydrogen volume in
metallic enviornments, including interstitial hydrogen and
elemental metallic hydrogen, follows a universal compression
curve, which can be expressed to a. good approximation by the
Vinet-type formula,

p=3Ko( 1-y)y-2e,, (l-y) , y=(V/Vo) 1/3

with the bulk modulus Ko=99.2 GPa, the initial volume Vo=2.96
x 10·3 nm3 and r; =4.47. Using this equation of state, we can
estimate the pressure required to reduce the interatomic
distance to ~ 0.015 nm. The value comes out to be 1.3 x 106 GPa
(6.2 x 105 GPa for 0.02 nm), which is of the order of
magunitude of the center pressure of the Jovian planets,
Jupiter and Saturn. The occurrence of a piezonuclear fusion is
only possible at these extremely high pressures hardly
attainable in laboratory experiments.


5. Dynamical processes of D+'s in metals

Let us consider a nuclear fusion to be caused by the
collision of incident energetic D+s with D+s in a metal lattice.

As the reaction cross section cr(E) increases steeply with
the energy of an incoming D nucleus, the total probability of
occurrence of such events depends solely on the availability of
high-energy D nuclei. Cosmic rays and the acceleration of
fracture-induced D+'s by transient electric fields built up across 
the cracks (fracto-fusion) have been proposed as possib]e
sources of such energetic particles.

In this section, I consider the fate of incident D+s with
energies of 1-500 keV after entering a metal lattice, whatever
their source may be. At these energies, the incoming D+'s
graduaJly lose their energies by interactions with conduction
electrons, and finally come to rest by creating lattice defects
when their energies decrease to -10 e V. As the relation
between the incident energy £0 and the total path length Ao is
approximately given by Ao oc � in this energy range, the
energy of an incident D+ decreases to £ = £0 (Ao - l)2/A0
2 after straggling over a distance / from the surface. For D+ in Pd, Ao =
O.lµm for £0 = 3 keV. The rapid dissipation of incident energies
restricts the possibility of nuclear fusion to within a thin
surface layer.

In special cases when the direction of an incident beam
lies within - l O of some principal crysta] axes or planes, the
penetration depth is increased by an order of magnitude (the
ion channeling), and the nuclear fusion rate will be enhanced
accordingly. The enhancement can be rather important
because the beam of incident D+'s is concentrated near the
center of channels where most of the interstitial D+'s (targets)
are located.

Another effect of high-energy incident particles is to
create a number of knocked-on D+'s which may induce
additional fusion events. This effect is most important when
incident particles are neutrons; the energy of neutrons can be
transferred efficiently to hydrogens to create energetic D+'s.

In any case, it must be emphasized that the high-energy
particles must be prepared outside solid samples. Particle
energies are always dissipated in solids, especially the energies
of charged particles in metals. The acceleration of any particles
in metals up to the order of kev is simply impossible.

Finally, I wish to rectify the misconception that strong
electric fields built up across the thin double layer near the
electrode may induce some nuclear events. It is not the
magnitude of field strengths but the energy acquired from the
electric field that matters. The energy of D+'s acquired by
acceleration across the double layer is - 0.1 eV at the largest,
which is completely negligible for nuclear events. 


6. Conclusion

The properties described here are the very ABC's of the
hydrogen-metal systems. In seeking for a mechanism of cold
fusion phenomena, one should not ignore these ABC's but find
some way to circumvent difficulties posed by them. The
difficulties are great for the occurrence of nuclear fusion
events, not to speak of the excess heat release. Even greater
difficulties are expected for other fusion reactions involving
pairs with higher-valence nuclei or three-body interactions.
The hydrogen-metal systems, with all these ABC's are by no
means friendly to cold nuclear fusion.
