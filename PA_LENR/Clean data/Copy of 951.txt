1. Introduction

Although considerable effort has been expended in the study of the H(D)-Pd 
system, 1,2 relatively little attention has been paid to the thermodynamic properties of 
compositions within the� (a') phase, in particular for x > 0.8. In the context of excess 
power production in the D-Pd system, this deficiency is particularly unfortunate since 
the attainment of loadings higher than about 0.85 appears to be one of the criteria 
necessary for its observation. 3-6 

Experimentally, the reproducible attainment and maintenance of 
electrochemical loadings larger than about 0.85 have proven to be more challenging 
than might be expected from cursory inspection of earlier literature and, presently, 
much of the effort in the "new hydrogen energy" field is devoted to this issue. Clearly, 
in order to understand fully the calorimetric behaviour of the H(D)-Pd system at 
elevated loadings (i.e. elevated values of the H(D) chemical potential, at modest 
temperatures and pressures 3), a number of thermodynamic issues must be addressed. A 
number of such issues are discussed briefly here; although both hydrogen and 
deuterium alloys are described, the data cited are for H-Pd (at 298 K) unless otherwise 
indicated. 


2. Non-ideality in the H(D)-Pd system

Any description of the thermodynamic properties of the B phase must take into 
account the fact that it is a non-ideal solution of hydrogen in palladium. Thus the 
thermodynamic state functions vary not only with temperature and pressure (or 
volume), but also with composition. The chemical potential of hydrogen in palladium 
may be written as:7 

µ = µ 0 + R T In � + µ ex 
1-x 

where the term µex is introduced to account for deviations from ideal solution 
behaviour. For didactic purposes at least, it is found convenient to regard the dissolved 
hydrogen as electronically screened protons. This leads to the decomposition ofµ ex into 
two (additive) terms: Firstly, an "elastic" term due to the dilation of the lattice on 
occupation by hydrogen. This term is increasingly negative with increasing x (very 
approximately linearly so) corresponding to a net attractive interaction between the 
screened protons. Secondly, an "electronic" term which reflects the rise in the Fermi 
level due to the electrons associated with the dissolved hydrogen. This term is 
increasingly positive with increasing x, increasing relatively slowly for x < 0.6 as the 
high density-of-states 4d band is occupied, but more rapidly, and approximately 
linearly, at higher loadings as electrons are forced to enter the low density-of-states 5s 
band (for a detailed account, see Ref. 2). For compositions in the � phase (x > 0.6) the 
electronic term dominates, leading to a linear variation ofµ with x, as has been 
observed experimentally for both H and D, at least up to x = 0.8.8,9 

The non-ideal nature of hydrogen in palladium has several consequences of 
interest in the context of loading. For example, the dependence of chemical potential on 
loading contributes directly to the Fick's law diffusion coefficient, 

aµ 
DF = M x­ox 

Recent measurements on the H-Pd system reveal that DF increases with x in the� 
phase lO indicating that the rapid rise ofµ with loading offsets the anticipated drop in 
mobility with increased octahedral site occupancy (however, contrary data have been 
reported 11 ). 

Another quantity of interest is the (relative) partial molar enthalpy of absorption 
in the � phase, Af-/ r• This is the enthalpy change for the constant temperature process 

½ H 2 (pO, T) � [H] (x, p, T) 

By considering Af-lr to be a function of volume and composition, we may derive the 
following compositional dependence2,
 1 2

+ J(oAf-lr) dx

V 

The second and third terms on the right-hand-side of Eqn. 4 behave analogously to the 
elastic and electronic contributions, respectively, to the chemical potential. In Fig. 1, 
the quantity "11Hr - Af-lr(x=O) - p VH" is plotted schematically versus loading, together 
with its "elastic" and "electronic" components.13 (Qualitatively, the behaviour of this

circles); calculated, H (l ine). Data from Refs. 9 and 14. 

quantity is the same as that of Aflr itself since the additional terms are either relatively 
small or constant). At low loadings, the partial molar enthalpy of absorption is 
exothermic, due to the dominance of the negative elastic contribution. However, similar 
to the behaviour of the chemical potential, in the p phase region the electronic term 
dominates, causing the relative partial molar enthalpy to become more positive with 
increasing loading. The results of a detailed statistical thermodynamical calculation of 
Aflr for hydrogen are shown in Fig. 2.14 It is apparent that, unless a phase change
occurs in the region 0.8 < x < 1.0, 6Hr is expected to become endothermic somewhere 
in this interval. In Figs. I and 2, it should be noted that the existence of the two-phase 
region for x < 0.6 has not been explicitly recognized; this is often the case in modelling 
studies based on equations such as (1) and (4). For increasing loading in the two-phase 
region, the molar enthalpy change is independent of composition and approximately -19
kJ mol-1 for H-Pd and -17 kJ mo1-1 for D-Pd.9 

Calorimetrically measured values of 6Hr are shown for both hydrogen and 
deuterium in Fig. 2. 9, 15 Although these data do not extend to particularly high loadings, 
they are in broad, if not exact, agreement with theoretical predictions. It is of interest to 
note that the exothermic/ endothermic transition is expected to occur at a lower loading 
for deuterium than for hydrogen. It should be remarked that experimental values of Af-lr 
are available in the literature for x > 0.9.1h However, other researchers have questioned 
these data l 7 and they are not included here. 

Since direct calorimetric measurement of Aflr at high x may be difficult, it is of 
interest to see if other experimental data may be used to derive Aflr values. From 
elementary thermodynamics we may derive 
where the first term on the right-hand-side is the partial molar enthalpy change for the 
process 

1 h H 2 (p, T) ➔ [HJ (x, p, T)

This is a negative quantity at accessible pressures. The second term corresponds to the 
molar enthalpy change (a positive quantity) for the process 

This latter process is well-characterised thermodynamically; thus calculation of 6Hr is 
essentially a matter of determining the pressure-compositions isotherms over a range of 
temperatures at high loadings. 

For a finite change in loading at constant temperature (involving the production 
or consumption of hydrogen gas at 1 atm.), the total enthalpy change is given by 

x2 
6H(x 1➔x2) = -1- ]Aflr dx
x2-x I XI 

Furthermore, the total energy change, LiU(x 1➔x2), and LiH(x1➔x2) differ by no more 
than about 1 kJ moJ-1, for loadings up to approximately unity.


3. Gas-phase vs. electrochemical loading

Gas-phase and electrochemical loading differ thermodynamically in two 
important respects: Firstly, with respect to the value ofµ for a given loading; secondly, 
with respect to the ease of measurement of µ (and, hence, the loading) for each loading 
method. In what follows, it is assumed that metallurgical considerations do not 
intervene to lower the loading below that (maximum) value which corresponds to the 
thermodynamic state of surface adsorbed hydrogen atoms, i.e. in the electrochemical 
steady-state, the metal is internally in equilibrium. Furthermore, for ease of expression, 
only acidic conditions are considered in the electrochemical case; the following 
arguments are unchanged for loading in basic solutions. Finally, during electrochemical 
loading, it is assumed that the ambient hydrogen pressure is 1 atm. 

The essential differences between gas-phase and electrochemical loading are 
illustrated in Fig. 3. In this figure, Ha represents a surface-adsorbed hydrogen atom, 
while Hi represents dissolved hydrogen. In gas-phase loading, a state may be reached 
where the environing hydrogen gas, surface adsorbed hydrogen atoms, dissolved 
hydrogen atom<; and any hydrogen gas formed in voids within the metal are in 
equilibrium. In this case, the loading at a given temperature is determined by the 
fugacity of the environing hydrogen gas (or hydrogen partial pressure, at pressures less 
than about 100 atm.). In the electrochemical case, on the other hand, the steady-state 
does not necessarily correspond to equilibrium between the environing hydrogen gas 
and the surface adsorbed hydrogen atoms. Hence, the sample experiences a hydrostatic 
pressure of 1 atm. regardless of the chemical potential of surface ads9rbed hydrogen 
atoms. (Note, however, that any gas formed in voids within the metal is in chemical 
equilibrium with the dissolved hydrogen, leading to pressurized voids). Thus, at a given 
loading, the chemical potential of dissolved hydrogen loaded electrochemically, 
µ(pO x), is related to the chemical potential obtained in gas-phase loading, µ(p, x), by 

p 
µ(p 0,x) = µ(p,x)-
fVHdP
po 

This difference, although conceptually important, is generally small numerically. In 
other words, those physical properties of gas-hided and electrochemically loaded 
palladium which are dependent of the chemical potential of hydrogen will differ only 
negligibly; for example, the pressure generated within voids in the metal when loaded 
electrochemically will be slightly less than that generated under gas-phase loading, for 
the same loading. As an aside, we note that a situation similar to electrochemical 
loading exists in so-called gas phase atomic loading, Fig. 3. Here, hydrogen atoms are 
generated continually in the gas phase from molecular hydrogen using a hot wire. These 
hydrogen atoms are not e4uilibrated with the molecular hydrogen, i.e. are formed with 
an elevated chemical potential, and arc thus capable of causing high loadings, as has 
been demonstrated experimentally.18 We speculate that the ultrasonic cavitation of 
water in the presence of a palladium substrate (where hydrogen atom generation is 
known to occur 19) will have similar consequences. 

The following question naturally arises: can we, in an electrochemical 
experiment, infer the loading of a palladium cathode from the measured cathode

overvoltage'? In gas-phase loading, knowledge of the hydrogen pressure and the 
temperature are sufficient to determine the palladium loading at equilibrium. Thus gas­
phase loading is generally not suitable for achieving very high loadings due to the 
experimental difficulties caused by the enormous pressures involved. In 
electrochemical loading, on the other hand, while it is possible to generate overvoltages 
at a palladium cathode which are, in principle, sufficient to raise the chemical potential 
of the dissolved hydrogen to values necessary for loadings approaching unity (greater 
than 35 kJ mol-1 or 0.35 e V for H), it is not possible to convert a measured overvoltage 
directly into a loading without detailed knowledge of the electrochemical reaction 
mechanism. This subject has been discussed extensively in the literature20-23 and only 
the key points are summarized here. 

In general, two extreme cases may be recognized: 
(i) For an electrochemical reaction in which the electron transfer (Volmer) step
has a relatively small - in the limit, zero - affinity (i.e. is in a state of "quasi­
equilibrium"): 
- The dissolved hydrogen is not equilibrated with the environing hydrogen.
- High loadings are possible (the chemical potential of dissolved hydrogen is
directly proportional to the (negative) overvoltage measured with respect to a
standard hydrogen reference electrode, ri).
- Metal voids are pressurized, leading potentially to cracking and blistering.
(ii) For an electrochemical reaction in which the hydrogen atom recombination
(Tafel) step is 111 quasi-equilibrium: 
- The dissolved hydrogen is equilibrated with the environing hydrogen.
- High loadings are not possible (the chemical potential of dissolved hydrogen is
given directly by the environing gas pressure and is not relatetl to the
overvoltage ).
- Metal voids are not pressurized.

It is important to realise that the two cases described above represent the upper 
and lower limits of a spectrum of possible behaviour (a third possibility, that of an 
atom-ion recombination (Heyrovsky) step in quasi-equilibrium, is similar to case (ii) in 
that it is not condusive to high loadings); in practice, the situation will be somewhere in 
between such that only a ji-action of the measured overvoltage is used to determine the 
chemical potential of dissolved hydrogen. This fraction is determined by the affinity 
distribution between the various elementary steps, which is turn is decided by the 
relative values of the forward and reverse reaction rates for each step. Thus, ultimately, 
the loading/ overvoltage (or loading/ current) functionality is determined by kinetic 
factors. Traditional electrochemical procedures may be used to induce a functionality 
which corresponds more closely to (the desirable) case (i) than (the undesirable) case 
(ii) above; for example, the addition of thiourea, which is known to increase the affinity
of the Tafel step (i.e. the overvoltage at constant current under case (i) conditions),
thereby preventing it reaching a state of quasi-equilibrium, and hence enhancing the
loading. 24.2'.i

In the event that the kinetic propertit:s of the system are such that, in the limit, 
case (i) behaviour is observed (or, in the general case, that the affinity of the Volmer 
step is independent of overvoltage), a simple relationship may be derived for the 
dependence of loading on overvoltage (or current). Under case (i) conditions (referred 
to in the electrochemical literature as "fast discharge/ slow recombination"), 

- F Tl= µ - µ*

whereµ* is the chemical potential of dissolved hydrogen with no applied overvoltage 
(i.e. that value corresponding to the environing hydrogen pressure). Up to loadings of 
about 0.8 (and perhaps beyond, although data are lacking), µ varies linearly with 
loading, as discussed above, and, hence 

T)=Ax+B 

where A and B are constant at a given temperature. Further, if Tafel' s law is obeyed, 
the loading is expected to vary logarithmically with the current. Experimental 
verification of these relationships has been obtained,5 even at loadings well above those 
at which the linear �l, x dependence has been observed empirically. 


4. Effect of temperature on loading

The results obtained above may be used to address the question: how does the 
loading of a palladium sample vary with temperature? In the general case, we may 
write: 

In the case of gas-phase loading, where equilibrium exists between the sample and the 
environing hydrogen, the first partial differential term on the right-hand-side of Eqn. 12 
may be expressed in terms of the properties of the environing hydrogen, giving 
where 11S6 and f1H6 are the partial molar entropy and enthalpy changes, respectively, of 
the reaction in Eqn. 6. These are negative quantities, leading to the expected result that, 
in gas-phase loading, raising the temperature at constant pressure will lower the 
loading. Note that Eqn. 13 is a mathematical statement of Le Chatelier's principle. 

In the case of electrochemical loading, where, if high loadings are to be 
obtained, the sample is not in equilibrium with its environment, Eqn. 13 may not be 
employed. Instead, we may utilize Eqn. 10 in order to cast the first partial differential 
term on the right-hand-side of Eqn. 12 into a more convenient form, and write 
where 11Sr is the partial molar entropy change of the reaction in Eqn. 3, a negative 
quantity. Eqn. 14 is valid for case (i) conditions, ciescribed in Sect. 3. (Of course, case 
(ii) conditions correspond to Eqn. 13). In the (likely) event that an intermediate case is
encountered, an additional partial differential must be added to the bracketed term in
Eqn. 14 in order to include the temperature dependence of the reaction affinity for the
Volmer step. Thus, in the case of electrochemical loading, a number of (ultimately)
kinetically-determined factors enter into the determination of (c)xJc)T)p0, the sign and 
magnitude of which are difficult to predict. Under case (i) conditions, in order to ensure 
that the loaciing increases as a result of a temperature step, the overvoltage must 
increase (become more negative) at constant current. The magnitude of this increase is 
given by Eqn. 14 if fiSr is known. Practically, an increasing overvoltage with increasing 
temperature (at first sight, an unlikely situation) might correspond to an increasingly 
"poisoned" recombination step (either atom-atom or atom-ion); for example, due to a 
change in electrode surface composition with increasing temperature. Finally, it will be 
noted that the value of fiHr is important in this context only to the extent that it 
contributes (partially) to Mr, 


5. Concluding remarks

The present discussion has centered on the properties of highly loaded 
compositions in the H(D)-Pd system. Unfortunately, a general absence of pertinent 
empirical data hampers a definitive development of many of the areas of inquiry dealt 
with here. In order to fully understand the properties of the highly loaded H(D)-Pd 
system, considerable experimental work is required in order to determine basic 
thermodynamic parameters for x > 0.8. This is particularly important if the possibility 
of new phase formation at elevated loadings cannot be discounted.
