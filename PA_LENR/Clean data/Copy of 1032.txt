1. INTRODUCTION

Starting in 1992, the ENEA Group of Frascati has concentrated its attention on the
phenomenon of heat excess production in electrolytic cells working with a Palladium cathode in
heavy water, with LiOD as the electrolyte. Due to the substantial lack of reproducibility in the
results reported up to then, a feature common to all laboratories, and to the consequent skepticism
of the traditional scientific community, it was clear that the accuracy of the calorimetry was
paramount, and this has been the aspect to which the Group has dedicated most of its attention in
the first years. A flow calorimeter was developed, reaching a very high degree of reliability, with a
high sensitivity, which permitted to keep the experimental errors in the measurement of excess
power well within 100 mW for time durations up to the order of months. Since then a series of
experiments has been performed, some of which with relevant figures as far as heat excess is
concerned, with the addition of some very stimulating side features: all of them have been presented
at the International Conferences on Cold Fusion and published in their Proceedings and in other
journals (1-4). In Table 1 the most relevant events of heat excess production measured by the Group
are listed, in order of time, with the indication of the most meaningful parameters. Note that at least
in two of the quoted experiments it was possible to exclude, by an accurate energy balance of the
whole run, the hypothesis, claimed by many skeptics, that the excess heat could be attributed to the
accumulation in the system, by an unknown mechanism, of chemical energy, the successive libera
tion of which could justify the production of heat. Thus, the conviction was reached in the Group 
that the heat excess production in deuterated Palladium was a reality and could not be attributed to 
known chemical processes.

from 1992 to 1995. 

A feature that has been increasingly clear, since the 2nd International Conference on Cold 
Fusion, in Como in 1991, is the correlation between the heat excess production and the amount of 
Deuterium absorbed within the Palladium lattice, usually measured as the D/Pd ratio (atomic). It has 
been demonstrated that a threshold in the D/Pd ratio has to be exceeded, in order to obtain the 
production of heat excess: the value of this threshold is of about 0.9, at least at the normal operation 
temperatures (around 300 K). Whether this condition is also sufficient has still to be proved. 
However, reaching such high ratios is not at all straightforward, and can depend on many 
parameters of the experiment, first among which the characteristics of the Palladium used. [We 
experienced very neatly this feature. After the first two positive results reported in Table 1, obtained 
with Palladium foils already present in the laboratory, we had to get more Palladium, and we did so, 
buying it from the same firm, with the same nominal characteristics; with it we made more 
experiments, but did not succeed in obtaining heat production. An analysis a posteriori of samples 
of the two stocks showed a different "texture" in the metal, a different hydrogen solubility and a 
different surface morphology.] 
This feature has had the effect of shifting the search for 
reproducibility from the whole experiment to the ability to obtain high D/Pd ratios. In the last two 
Conferences of this series we have witnessed the strong effort performed by many groups to face 
this problem. 

The ENEA Frascati Group has dedicated most of its resources in the last year to the study 
and to the solution of this problem. The first step was to master the measurement of the D/Pd ratio, 
through the measurement of the electrical resistance of the cathode. Then a fundamental approach 
was chosen, which consisted in the attempt to analyse rationally the mechanisms responsible for the 
absorption of Hydrogen ( or Deuterium) in Palladium, trying to single out features that could be 
responsible for the difficulty in absorption above D/Pd = 0.7. The stress field created by the 
concentration gradients during absorption has been investigated, with the aim of finding ways to 
overcome its negative effects. This will be described in next chapter. 

Other two activities of the Group are worth mentioning, but will not be considered any more 
in the following:

the development of a quantum mechanical approach, with a model aimed to explain possible 
mechanisms that justify cold fusion (5); 

the development of a circuit for the detection of 4He as a nuclear ash of the process, which is in 
progress. 


2. STRESS FIELD EFFECTS ON THE LOADING OF HYDROGEN ISOTOPES IN PALLADIUM CATHODES 

The dissolution of hydrogen isotopes into a metal lattice is not only a problem of 
thermodynamic equilibrium between the hydrogen inside the lattice and the hydrogen in the 
external phase, but is also a problem of non- equilibrium in the metal, because of the occurrence of 
a transport process. Both aspects of the phenomenon are correlated, since the equilibrium 
concentration of the solute is achieved when the chemical potentials of the hydrogen in both 
phases are equal and the transport process inside the metal lattice is driven by the gradient of the 
chemical potential. On the other side, the chemical potential of the hydrogen in solid solution in a 
metal lattice is strongly influenced by all field forces, such as the stress field, which modify the free 
energy of the system. The hydrogen isotopes dissolving into a metal ( e.g. palladium) occupy 
interstitial positions and expand the lattice. This process generates a stress field when remarkable 
concentration differences (strong gradients or coexistence of different phases) are created. This 
stress field can inhibit the diffusion process. In the presence of a stress field the chemical potential 
of the hydrogen in the palladium is modified: 

µ= µ -Vcrh 

whereµ 0 is the chemical potential in the system without stress, Vis the molar volume of the solute 
and cr h the trace of the stress tensor. In the presence of a stress field the flux equation becomes: 

CP"" 
J= -D(VC- RT Va) 

where C is the hydrogen concentration, R the gas constant, T the temperature, and CJ the local stress. 

The diffusive flux becomes zero if: 

L1cr 
RT 
L1C = CP"" 

It is easy to evaluate that, for Pd, /).CJ is less than CJ around a dislocation (6). From the previous 
consideration it is clear that, during the loading process, the stress field can strongly affect the 
equilibrium concentration of the hydrogen in the lattice. 

In Palladium, during the loading procedure, regions of higher lattice parameter (� phase) 
grow within regions of lower lattice parameter (a phase). In the region of coexistence ( a + P 
phases), see fig.1 a, the lattice parameter mismatch at the border between the two phases generates a 
very strong localised stress field, which is unfavourable for diffusion (coherent stress). If internal 
stresses can be removed, either by plastic deformation or by dislocation slipping, such stress-free 
strained crystals become "incoherent": see fig.lb. We have suggested that the negative effects due 
to the coexistence of a and p phases can be avoided during the loading process, by selecting an 
appropriate path on the pressure-concentration phase diagram: a detailed explanation of such a 
procedure is exposed in another paper presented at this Conference, together with the encouraging 
results obtained (7). 

The loading process can be inhibited also by a stress gradient behind the external surface. 
The stress field effect behind the metal surface is similar, in terms of stress production, to the effect 
of a strong temperature gradient. The zone at higher temperature ( concentration) is forced to 
expand, but is bound to a zone at lower temperature (concentration) that doesn't expand or expands

much less. Thus, in the zone at high concentration, compressed by the zone at low concentration, 
the chemical potential of the solute increases and the loading can be inhibited: see fig.2. This 
condition can be modified by creating a metallurgical structure in the sample able to minimize the 
gradients of concentration. Now we can study, in the case of an ideal system, the effect of some 
metallurgical parameters, like the boundary grain size and the diffusivity, on the mass transport 
process taking place during the loading (8). The grain/grain-boundary system is sketched in fig.3; a 
simple diffusive mass balance across the grain-boundary and across the grain gives the following 
system of differential equations (9):

with boundary conditions: y=O, t=O, C=C0; y>O, t=O, C=O; x=O, Cg
=Cb,, where the indexes g and b 
refer to the grain and the grain-boundary respectively; c is the grain-boundary size, D the diffusion 
coefficient and C the solute concentration. 

In fig. 4 and 5 the surface plots of the concentration profile in a grain are reported for two 
different cases, after the same loading time. In fig. 4 the size of the grain boundary is O. lµm while 
in fig.5 it is 1 µm. In the former the resulting concentration gradient in the grain is larger than in 
the latter. This result has been obtained under the hypothesis of an ideal system, without impurity 
at the grain boundary. When impurities are present at the grain-boundary, the grain-boundary 
diffusion coefficient generally is smaller. If, in our simulation, we consider two different situations, 
with the same grain boundary size, but with a different grain-boundary diffusion coefficient, the 
outcome is that the concentration gradient in the grain is larger in the system where the diffusion 
coefficient at grain-boundary is lower: in other words, the presence of impurities can increase the 
concentration gradient. 

Let us now consider the effect of the stress-field produced by the concentration gradient 
during loading, in terms of equilibrium loading. By using the well known stress (cr) vs strain (E) 
relationship, c:r-&: (where E is the Young module), and the relationship between strain and 
concentration for the Pd beta phase ( I 0): 

E (C) = [1 + 0.044(C- C13 minJ] 

the following transport equation is carried out: 

where T\ is the percentage of relaxed stresses. 

Figure 6 shows the result of the calculations: when the percentage of the relaxed stresses is 
sufficiently high (rf�0.85), the behaviour is substantially Fickian and the asymptotic loading value 
is H(D)/Pd=l; but, if the system is not able to relax more than 70% of the stresses produced by the 
loading, the asymptotic evolution changes. A further reduction of T] produces a spontaneous 
deloading and the equilibrium concentration can be modified. The sample considered here is 
supposed to have been gas pre-loaded according to the technique described in (7). 

Figure 6. Effect of the unrelaxed stresses, produced by the diffusing Hydrogen, on the H/Pd value. 

Thus, a further increase of the loading can be obtained if the stresses are allowed to relax. 
The value of the yield stress gives us useful information on the ability of the material to relax 
stresses, on the basis of its initial metallurgical properties. Hence, the initial state of the sample is 
very important in reducing the blocking force arising from the stress field. We measured the yield 
stress for Pd-H samples submitted to gas pre-loading. Samples where the coexistence of the a and� 
phases was avoided show a yield stress 50% lower. Higher values were obtained for cold worked 
samples, see Table 2.

treatments of Palladium. 


3. EXPERIMENT AL RESULTS IN ELECTROLYSIS

On the basis of these considerations, we decided to perform some metallurgical treatments 
on the Pd samples, then submitting them to electrolytic charging of Hydrogen or Deuterium, 
looking for maximum loading. The description of the tests performed with this purpose, including 
cold working and annealing at different temperatures for different times, is exposed in detail in the 
paper already mentioned, presented at this Conference (7). This allowed us to select the structure 
that better fits the afore mentioned characteristics. In particular, by varying the thermal treatment 
temperature from 700 to 1100°C, we found that the grain dimension and the dislocation slipping 
form a kind of percolative network for samples conditioned at 900°C for one hour. A possible 
interpretation of such a result is that in this sample the concentration profiles are quite flat, since the 
hydrogen diffusion is enhanced by the dislocation cores and/or by the ability of such a material to 
relax the stresses. Charging ratios of 1 for Hydrogen and 0.96 for Deuterium were obtained with a 
satisfactory reproducibility. 

Another interesting effect found in the experiments is the correlation between the loading 
dynamics and the loading ratio. We observed that after loading at constant current density for a 
certain time, the concentration of the solute in the metal doesn't increase any more and sometimes a 
de-loading takes place. On the basis of the concepts exposed in the previous section we assumed 
that such a behaviour was promoted by the creation of a stress field very close to the surface of the 
sample under cathodic loading. Then we tried to remove the stresses by inverting the current for a 
few seconds (anodic polarization of the sample) and/or applying a low-high current mode, just to 
avoid the creation of a new stress field. The effect of this technique is well described in fig.7. A 
change in the period of the low-high current mode and an increase of the current also produce a 
positive effect on the loading ratio. 

The material showing the best hydrogen (deuterium) solubility has been used for 
calorimetric measurements under electrochemical loading in heavy water. The calorimetric system 
was the same described in previous papers ( 1-4 ). The cathode was a palladium foil 150 µm thick 
and with a surface of 2 cm2 for each side. The loading ratio achieved a value of 0.96 with a current 
density of 50 mA/cm2, and an excess heat could be measured as a function of the current density, in 
good agreement with the well known Storm's curve, reaching a maximum of 150 mW for 100 
mA/cm2. In Fig. 8 three successive runs are shown, the last of which, performed after a refilling of 
the solution, "killed" the effect. This effect seems to confirm that the region close to the surface 
plays a fundamental role in the process.

density is reported. For the last the D/Pd ratio was lower then the threshold: thus, no heat excess was

4. CONCLUSIONS

The main activity of the ENEA Frascati Group in the last year has been concentrated on the 
achievement of high Hydrogen or Deuterium loadings in Palladium cathodes in a reproducible way. 

A rational approach has been chosen, by analysing the absorption mechanisms in terms of the stress 
fields created in the sample, and the consequent concentration gradients, which can be responsible 
of inhibiting the loading. 

In practice, three roads have been followed, in order to overcome this problem, in the light 
of the quoted analysis: 

a particular charging procedure has been settled, consisting in a pre-loading in gas of the 
sample with a path (on the phase diagram) aimed to avoid the coexistence (a+�) phase;

an optimized pre-treatment of the sample (annealing at 900°C for 1 hour) has been chosen; 

the dynamics of charging, i.e., short anodic polarization and high-low mode of the current, has 
helped as well. 

All three procedures have contributed to the achievement of reproducible high charging 
ratios in Palladium samples (up to 1 for Hydrogen and to 0.96 for Deuterium). The first tests with 
heavy water in a calorimeter seem to indicate that heat excess is produced when the well known 
threshold for D/Pd (0.9) is exceeded.
