1. Introduction

In our previous studies, we observed anomalous heat in Pd|D2O electrolytic cells by Seebeck Envelope Calorimetry
(SEC) [1−5]. Two factors were found to be very important for experimental reproducibility. One is that the temperature
increment (i.e. the difference between steady temperature and initial temperature) during electrolysis must be high

enough; otherwise no excess heat will be observed [3]. Another is that the electrolysis of a Pd sample in an open cell
is an effective way to activate the cathode for excess heat production in subsequent electrolysis in a closed cell [5]. In
this paper, deep research on pretreatment methods will be reported.

McKubre et al. [6] and Kunimatsu et al. [7] reported that D/Pd > 0.8–0.9 is a necessary condition to obtain excess
heat in Pd|D2O electrolytic systems around room temperature. This requirement is in conflict with our experiences
[1−5]. From April 2011, we have been measuring in situ the D/Pd ratio in electrolysis and calorimetry. The results
showed that high loadings of D into Pd are unnecessary for excess heat production.

In recent years Violante’s group found that the surface morphology of the cathode plays a key role in excess heat
production in Pd|D2O electrolytic cells [8,9]. This conclusion is similar to our discovery on pretreatment because both
of them are surface effects. In this paper, we will report the characteristics of effective Pd surfaces.


2. Experimental Set-up

The electrolytic cell used from January 2011 to October 2014 was an advanced model compared to the previous design
[5]. Its schematic and photo are shown in Figs. 1(a) and (b), respectively. The cell is made of borosilicate glass
(ϕin 41 × ϕout 45 × 130 mm3
) and it has a PTFE cap with a SS316 pipe connected to a deuterium gas cylinder and
a pressure gauge. The bottom part of the male cap has two grooves of 4 mm width and 2.5 mm depth for O-rings
(ϕin = 31.5 mm, width = 3.55 mm, made of nitrile butadiene rubber) to seal the cell. In addition, the cap has five
holes for electrode leads as shown in Fig. 1(a). High-temperature sealant (Thomas Technologies Co. Ltd, Chengdu,
China), which solidifies at 120◦C, is filled into the gaps between the leads and the cap to prevent escape of the off gases
from the cell. A Pt cylindrical mesh filled with recombination catalyst (Alfa Aesar, Stock #89106, Lot #C24R036)
to recombine excess D2 and O2 is suspended under the PTFE cap as shown in Fig. 1(b). The quantity of catalyst
generally varies from 35 to 45 pellets (weight ∼ 0.05 g /pellet).

From November 2014 to now, a SS316 flange was used outside the borosilicate cylinder to prevent an explosion,
as shown in Fig. 1(c). The cap is also made of SS316, and is covered with Teflon coating to prevent corrosion. Cored
screws and small O-rings are used to seal gaps between the leads and cap as partly shown in Fig. 1(c). Four screws
are used to fix the cap and the flange. This cell gives better pressure tightness than the prior one. However, the Teflon
coating is not so stable and has to be replaced after some runs.

The electrolyte is D2O + D2SO4 mixed solution, to which we always added 0.2–0.4 g of titanium powder.
Both deuterated reagents are from Beijing Chemical Reagent Company (>99.9 atom % D) with the mass ratio of
D2O:D2SO4 about 5:1. The platinum foil (normally 0.02 × 31 × 43 mm3
) anode and leads are from General Research Institute for Nonferrous Metals (GRINM) as before [3].
Palladium samples from four different sources were used during the experiments. The physical properties, pretreatment methods and maximum excess power produced during electrolysis in closed Pd|D2O cells are listed in Table 1
for Pd #4 to 33 in total of 157 runs from July 27, 2011 to May 26, 2016. Most of samples are from Alfa Aesar,
Stock #11514, 99.9% purity. Pd #6, provided by John Dash, is also from Alfa Aesar. Pd #4, 5 and 17, provided by
Da-Lun Wang, are from Kunming Institute of Precious Metals (KIPM). Pd #7, 18 and 27 are from GRINM, 99.95%
purity. Pd #20 and 21 are from AVIC Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials (BIAM). Before the first electrolysis
run, a Pd sample from Alfa or KIPM is cold rolled to the desired thickness and then washed with pure alcohol and
de-ionized water to remove surface contamination. A scanning electron microscope in combination with an energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS; HITACHI, S-4300) is used to characterize the Pd surface morphology and elemental
composition. A 3D Noncontact Optical Profiler (BRUKER ContourGT) and an Atomic Force Microscope (BRUKER
Dimension FastScan AFM) are used to measure the surface roughness.

Five Pt leads (ϕ0.8 mm), covered with heat-shrink Teflon tubing for protection, are welded to the Pt anode and a
Pd cathode by a spot-welder. The loading ratios of D/Pd are determined by the resistance method using HIOKI 3560
AC mΩ HiTESTER to avoid DC voltage shifts during electrolysis, as discussed [10].

Before and after each electrolysis, the cell is weighed with a Mettler balance (PM1200, 1 mg readability) to
monitor the weight loss. If the catalyst is working well, electrolysis at 3 A for 10 h will induce mass loss ∆m <0.2 g
and the corresponding decomposition energy of heavy water will be less than 3 kJ; otherwise, the calorimetry may be
complicated because excess heat is not prominent in these tests.

Three K-type thermocouples are attached outside the cell for temperature measurements, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The
first is at the height of the recombination catalyst to monitor the recombining process of deuterium and oxygen gases.
The second thermocouple is at the height of electrolyte level, and the third is on the bottom of the cell. The average
value of the second and third temperatures is considered to be the electrolyte temperature in this paper. Generally, the
temperature around the electrolyte level was greater than that of bottom by 5–10◦C during experiments.
The power supply and data logging system are similar to that [5] with some modifications. All parameters are
measured every 10 s. The input energy is the integration of input power (electrolytic current × cell voltage) with
electrolysis time. The output energy is the integration of output power with electrolysis time and cooling time (around
10 h) of a heated cell.

Measurement of excess power is made by a decimeter-size heat-flow calorimeter which was fully demonstrated
to have stability and accuracy in [4,5,11]. The electrolytic cell is placed in an enamel jar filled with cotton for heat
insulation as shown in Figs. 1(d) and (e). The jar is located in the center of the measuring vessel with inner sizes
of 26 cm × 26 cm × 26 cm and the air in the vessel is mixed with a fan to ensure temperature homogeneity. The

Table 1. Summary of excess power for various samples from July 27, 2011 to May 26, 2016.

calorimeter is calibrated with an electric heater in 2-W steps, up to a power level greater than the electrolysis power,
e.g. the maximum calibration power is 12 W if the electrolysis power is planned to be around 10 W. The input power
P and output signal E can be simulated by a linear equation. For accuracy, we fit their relationship with a quadratic
form:
P = D1E + D2E
2
, (1)
where P is the input power in Watts and E is the output electromotive force in Volts; D1 is the device constant
in W V−1
; D2 is the coefficient of the quadratic term. The intercept term in Eq. (??) is forced to zero to ensure
no signal without input power. The device constantD1 and the uncertainty over more than 41 months are shown in
Fig. 2. Fluctuations of room temperature in different seasons affect the long-term precision; however, this calorimeter
is calibrated every 2–4 weeks when it is used in experiments, and this is accurate enough to give a true signal of
excess power with the uncertainty around 30 mW for many experiments. At the same time, we consider a result to
be assured production of excess heat only when both of the excess power and the excess energy (output energy minus
input energy) are positive values, to avoid misjudgments. If both of them are negative and the mass loss rate of the cell
in electrolysis is greater than 20 mg h−1
, the result has to be considered a failed experiment.

On Oct. 10, 2014 (Exp. #141010), a control experiment was conducted with a Pt foil (0.02 × 17 × 29 mm3
) in
place of Pd cathodes. Electrolysis current of 3 A was applied for 12 h, the input and excess power were 8.462 ± 0.003
W and − 0.014 ± 0.019 W, respectively, under steady state. Another control experiment (Exp. #141012) was done
using Pd #27. (We had difficulty producing excess heat with this batch of samples.) The stable excess power was −
0.029 ± 0.019 W while the input power was 8.721 ± 0.004 W at 3 A. These two results and other negative results with
Pd|D2O all confirmed that our calorimetry is credible.


3. Results

3.1. Effects of D/Pd ratio and other parameters on excess power:
The relationship between the resistance ratio and the D/Pd ratio at room temperature has been well known for many
years [10,12,13]; however, the temperature coefficient of resistance of Pd–D, αD, in the miscibility gap has not been
determined up to now, so the similar parameter of Pd–H, αH, had to be used by various groups in the past. We found
that the application of αH to the Pd–D system will induce what appears to be a physically impossible result, i.e. the
D/Pd ratio will increase with time but not decrease as expected in a short period just after electrolysis is stopped.
Therefore, we had to determine αD by ourselves. We calculated it using the resistance data during the cooling process
after the electrolysis is stopped, as shown in Fig. 3(a). Of course, we had to ensure resistance only decreases linearly

Figure 2. Changes of device constant (average value hD1i = 5.8246 ± 0.0312 (0.54%) W V−1
) and uncertainty (average value hσi =
24.3 ± 8.6 mW) of the calorimeter at 25◦C (the set temperature for all results listed in this paper) over 41 months (Dec. 27, 2012 to June 11, 2016).

with temperature, and this means only part of data from cooling is chosen, as shown in Fig. 3(b). αD with 0 <D/Pd
<0.7 is obtained by collecting some runs of experiments as shown in Fig. 4 and simulated by a linear equation, the
resulted resistance coefficient is
αD/K
−1 = 0.003965 − 0.003597x. (2)

24, 2012. The corresponding fitting formula is Eq. (??).

In our experiments, the D/Pd ratio at different temperatures was determined in situ by combining this factor and
Eqs. (??) and (13) in [10]. Of course, αD here must also be considered as a qualitatively and acceptable substitute of
αH, it needs to be measured in carefully designed experiments in future.

Figure 5 shows an example of in situ D/Pd ratio measurement during excess heat production in electrolysis. We
find that the cathode resistance and the cell temperature increase with time as shown in Figs. 5(a) and (b), respectively.
The D/Pd ratio increases with time due to deuterium absorption at the beginning of electrolysis; however, the cathode
begins to desorb deuterium after 12 min of electrolysis, because the temperature is too high as we discussed previously
[14]. It is found that the average D/Pd ratio is only 0.60 when excess power is 0.103 W as shown clearly in Fig. 5(c).
This is in direct conflict with the previous conclusion that high loading ratios of D/Pd are needed for excess power
production [6,7].

Figure 6 is a collection of data from 75 runs of positive results with excess power, with 21 samples. It illustrates
how excess power is dependent on different parameters. Because the D/Pd ratio was not measured before July 2011,
and it was not successfully measured in every run after that, the data points in Fig. 6(a) are from only 33 runs with
16 samples. We find that there is no clear correlation between the excess power and the D/Pd ratio. Most excess heat
occurs when D/Pd is 0.5–0.7 below the threshold value of 0.8–0.9 cited [6,7]. This means that high loading ratios of
D/Pd are not necessary for excess heat production. Another effect is the initial D/Pd ratio; we obtained excess heat
for Pd samples both with deuterium already absorbed (e.g. Fig. 5(a)) and without any deuterium at the beginning of
electrolysis. Therefore, the initial D/Pd ratio has no clear influence on excess heat production. In our experiments, the
closed cell was only filled with deuterium gas to increase the D/Pd ratio in some runs; however, we did not find effects
of atmospheres on the deuterium absorption during electrolysis. Therefore, we always carried out experiments with

the closed systems with only air in the cell.

On the other hand, from Fig. 6(c), we find there is clear correlation between the excess power and the cell temperature as observed by us previously [3] and also reported by Storms recently [15].
In our experiments, we intentionally increase the cell temperature by using more cotton in the jar, although the
applied current heat the cell at the same time. This is the reason why there is correlation between the excess power and
the current density as shown in Fig. 6(b) but Figs. 6(b) and (c) are unlike each other.

3.2. The effects of different pretreatments on excess heat reproducibility:
In a previous paper [5], we reported that open electrolyzing of Pd cathode in D2SO4 heavy water solution until the
electrolyte is used up is an effective way to stimulate excess heat in subsequent runs of electrolysis, and Pd #1 maintained its activity after lying in a sample box for more than 6 months. Since then, we used this sample as a cathode
in a H2O cell in two runs (Exp. #091001 and 091002) for blank calorimetry [5]. After that, this sample was dead; it
produced no excess heat in subsequent 13 runs of calorimetry with three runs of open electrolyzing for activation. It

seems that history of H contamination suppresses excess heat production in Pd–D systems. Only Pd #2 and 4 in [5]
were still active or could be activated by open electrolyzing thereafter.

In 2012, we tested Pd #5A from KIPM in 17 runs of calorimetry with four runs of open electrolyzing for activation;
however, only one run (Exp. #120612) gave excess power of 73 ± 17 mW just after open electrolyzing (Exp. #120611).
On Dec. 17, 2012, Pd #5A was cold rolled to 0.33 mm from original thickness of 0.5 mm and it was designated Pd #5B.

Table 1. Summary of excess power for palladium samples pretreated with etching in aqua regia.

After soaking in sulfuric acid for 15 min and washing, it was assembled to the cell for electrolysis and calorimetry. It
showed a sign of excess power of 32 ± 32 mW the next day (Exp. #121218). This sample showed excess heat in two
runs over 12 runs of calorimetry with one run of open electrolyzing for activation. The maximum excess power was
59 ± 32 mW in Exp. #130110 at applied current of 3 A and a cell temperature of 92◦C.

From Aug. 24 to Sep. 6, 2013, Pd #7 from GRINM was tested in five runs of calorimetry with three runs of open
electrolyzing for activation. The maximum excess power was only 28 ± 26 mW in Exp. #130827 just after activation
by open electrolyzing the day before. In our experience, it is difficult to produce excess heat with this batch of samples
from GRINM.

As far as open electrolyzing is concerned, three processes take place in this procedure. The first is etching by acid,
the second is heating in acid and the third is electrolyzing. To distinguishing the effects of these three processes, we
designed three treatment methods with samples Pd #8 to 33, from September 2013, as shown in Table 1 and discussed
below.

3.2.1. Etching in aqua regia:
Five samples (Pd #8 to 11, 29B) were pretreated with etching in aqua regia, and 11 runs of calorimetry were carried
out. Most of these runs did not produce any excess heat, as shown in Table 2. Now we take Pd #8 as an example to
illustrate the calorimetric results shown in Table 3. We find that only a little excess heat was observed in Exp. #130917
when Pd was etched in aqua regia for 15 min and then electrolyzed for 12 h at 3 A, whereas there was no excess power
in the other three runs with this sample (Exp. #130919/23/25).

Because mass losses from the cell were prominent in experiments during 2013, we tested this pretreatment method
again in 2015. We chose Pd #29A, which had given the maximum excess heat after pretreated with open electrolyzing
(see Section 3.2.3), and we cold rolled it to the thickness of 0.12 mm and designated it Pd #29B. It was etched in aqua
regia for 72 s and about 6.4 µm of thickness from the surface was removed, according to its mass loss (from 1.0624
to 0.9496 g). The subsequent electrolysis at 3 A for 12 h only gave excess power of 6 ± 14 mW (Exp. #150705).
The mass loss of this run was only 28 mg. All experiments listed in Tables 2 and 3 show that etching alone has no
significant effect on excess heat production.

Table 2. Summary of excess power for Pd #8 pretreated with etching in aqua regia.

Table 3. Summary of excess power for palladium samples pretreated with heating in D2SO4.

3.2.2. Heating in D2SO4:
Thirty-two runs of calorimetry with 11 samples were conducted to study the effects of pretreatment by heating in
D2SO4 on subsequent electrolysis, as shown in Table 4. Details of Pd #16 as an example are listed in Table 5; we find
that most runs with this sample show excess heat after activation. It produced maximum excess power of 117 ± 24
mW in Exp. #140107 after being heated for 2 h and reaching the maximum temperature of 244◦C in pretreatment. In
all 11 samples listed in Table 4, 9 samples produced excess power but only four of them give maximum excess power
Pex,max >3σ, the rest are not so activated, although reproducibility is high for this method.

3.2.3. Electrolyzing in D2SO4:
Fifty runs of calorimetry with 12 Pd samples were performed to test the effect of open electrolyzing in pretreatment
on excess heat production in subsequent electrolysis, as shown in Table 6. All runs with Pd #29A as an example are
listed in Table 7. Before open electrolyzing, PTFE sealing tape is used to wrap the cell cap to protect the O-ring from
corrosion by evolution gas, an open bottle is filled with D2SO4 until the Pd cathode is completely immersed, and
the electrolysis current is usually set as 4 A. During 3 h of open electrolyzing in Exp. #141209 with Pd #29A, the
maximum temperature reached 228◦C at 2.5 h. In subsequent electrolysis in a closed cell at 4 A for 15 h, the stable
excess power Pex reached 103 ± 19 mW from 10 to 11 h. The activity of this sample continued in the next two runs
as observed before [5]. It gave 128 ± 19 and 82 ± 19 mW in Exp. #141212 and 141214, respectively, without any
pretreatment, as shown in Table 7. From Table 6, we find the reproducibility of this method is 25/50 (50%), which
is somewhat less than the heating method of 21/32 (66%); however, there are six samples giving excess power of

Table 4. Summary of excess power for Pd #16 pretreated with heating in D2SO4.

Table 5. Summary of excess power for palladium samples pretreated with open electrolyzing in D2SO4.

Pex,max >3σ in all 11 samples tested. In comparison, this parameter is only four in all 11 samples for heating method
in Table 4. This means open electrolyzing is apparently the most effective method of activation.

3.2.4. Other activation methods:
It was reported that applying reverse current for 1 h in electrolysis can activate a Pd cathode for excess heat production
[16]; however, we tested five samples in eight runs (Exp. #080731, 080804, 081125 & 081130 with Pd #1; Exp.
#090527 with Pd #2; Exp. #121118 with Pd #6; Exp. #130914 with Pd #8; Exp. #140319 with Pd #23) and no
significant excess heat was stimulated by this method.

We also tested reverse polarization in pretreatment during open electrolyzing (Exp. #090814, 090915 and 090921
with Pd #1), there was no excess heat observed in subsequent calorimetry for closed electrolysis. Only one positive
example came from Pd #4, when we applied reverse polarization of 3 A for 20 min at the beginning of pretreatment
with open electrolyzing, then normal current of 3.5 A was applied for 2 h and 3.75 A was applied for 1 h successively
(Exp. #110728). The subsequent four runs of calorimetry with closed electrolysis gave excess power of 96 ± 15 mW
in Exp. #110729, 117 ± 15 mW in Exp. #110802, 52 ± 15 mW in Exp. #110804, and 88 ± 15 mW in Exp. #110805.
However, we are not sure of the role of reverse electrolysis here.

It has been said that an oxide layer on the palladium surface may be important for excess heat production [17,18].
In ICCF17, Dash et al. also reported that Pd and Ti foils being heated in flame at 700◦C for 20–60 min had given
excess power in subsequent electrolysis [19]. At our request, John Dash sent us three samples (Pd #6 in Table 1 and
two Ti foils). We tested the Pd sample in six runs (Exp. #121013/14/16/17/24, 121115) at current of 3 A. Only three
runs produced a little excess heat with the maximum value of 61 ± 23 mW in Exp. #121017. We also activated it by
electrolyzing two times; however, it did not produce excess heat in the two subsequent runs (Exp. #121117/18) after

Table 6. Summary of excess power for Pd #29A pretreated with open electrolyzing in D2SO4.

Table 7. Summary of excess power for Pd samples plated with Au and Cu.

the first open electrolyzing (Exp. #121116). It only gave small excess power of 40 ± 26 mW in the first two of total
four runs (Exp. #121120/21/22/29) after the second open electrolyzing (Exp. #121119). One Ti foil (0.6596 g,
0.4 × 10 × 39 mm3
, Alfa Aesar, 99.99% metals basis) did not give excess heat in four runs of electrolysis (Exp.
#130529/30/31 and 130602) too.

The situation was similar for Pd #21. It was soaked in fused potassium hydroxide (a.k.a. mercerizing) about
20 years ago and the surface is black. It did not produce excess heat in the first run of electrolysis (4 ± 33 mW in
Exp. #140224). After heating in hot D2SO4, the excess power in subsequent electrolysis was still within the range of
uncertainty (23 ± 33 mW in Exp. #140226).

We tried to deposit inert metals on the surface of palladium after deuterium was absorbed in order to seal the
deuterium into the sample, thereby testing if this method could trigger excess heat. Two samples were tested in 5
runs, as shown in Table 8. Au or Cu was deposited on the Pd surface by means of electroplating. Firstly, one of the
samples was heated in D2SO4 for 1–2 h, and then electrolysis was carried out for the Pd cathode in the cell used for
calorimetry. After the D/Pd ratio reaching saturation value, the Pt anode shown in Fig. 1 was switched to Au or Cu
(Alfa Aesar, 99.99%) for some minutes. Cu was easily plated; however, it was difficult to form an Au deposit because
of the insolubility of Au in sulfuric acid. Both current and time affect the plating thickness, as shown in Table 8. There
is no clear evidence that this method can improve excess heat production.

3.2.5. Comparison of different treatment methods:
Table 9 compares the effects of different pretreatments on excess heat production for different Pd samples. We find
that etching in aqua regia only gives the maximum excess power of 45 ± 18 mW and 18% reproducibility; heating
in D2SO4 induces maximum excess power of 117 ± 24 mW and 66% reproducibility; open electrolyzing in D2SO4
leads to the maximum excess power of 128 ± 19 mW and 50% reproducibility. Although heating produced higher
reproducibility than open electrolyzing, the latter method has a sample rate of 3/11 with Pex >100 mW while the
former has only 1/11. This means that open electrolyzing is the most effective method of activation. Figure 6(d) shows
effects of maximum temperature reached in pretreatment (heating or open electrolyzing of Pd in D2SO4) on excess
heat, higher temperature of pretreatment will induce higher excess power as expected. We feel that we need to achieve
much higher temperature in future research.

Of course, reproducibility is also source and sample dependent. Pd plates from GRINM were difficult to activate; four samples (Pd #3 in [5], Pd #7, 18 and 27 here) only gave maximum excess power of 48 ± 16 mW with
reproducibility of 2/11. Generally, we only use this batch without any pretreatment in control experiments to test the

Table 8. Comparison of different pretreatments on excess power for samples Pd #8 to 33

accuracy and validity of our calorimetry. On the other hand, samples from one batch of Alfa Aesar showed different
levels of excess heat production from one to another. For example, Pd #28 to 33 were all cut from a plate of Lot
#J30Z002 and were all pretreated with open electrolyzing; however, Pd #33 only gave maximum excess power of 61
± 45 mW (Exp. #150328) and reproducibility of 1/8 while both #31 and 32 gave excess power greater than 100 mW
The reasons of this sample dependent on excess heat production are unknown at present.

3.3. Surface characteristics of Pd samples:
As reported by the Violante group [8,9], the surface morphology of a Pd sample is very important for its excess heat
production in electrolysis. For this purpose, we cut a small part from some typical Pd samples in every phase and
studied them with light and electron microscopes. Now we take Pd #16 as an example to demonstrate our primary
results. This sample was pretreated by heating in D2SO4 and gave excess power up to 117 ± 24 mW, as shown in
Tables 1 and 5. Its photos in three different phases are shown in Fig. 7; we find its surface becomes rough after heating
and electrolysis in D2SO4, as expected.

3.3.1. Changes of surface roughness:
To quantitatively characterize the surface morphology, we used a non-contact 3D optical profiler (BRUKER ContourGT) to measure roughness, as shown in Fig. 8 and listed in Table 10. It is clear that all roughness parameters
under different definitions increase by around one order of magnitude after heating in D2SO4, and they increase again
by 1/10 to 1/2 after electrolysis for 12 h. AFM study on Pd #14 also support this conclusion, i.e. open electrolyzing
also roughens the surface. These results agree with the discovery of the Violante group [8,9]. Of course, more
study on comparison of different pretreatments on surface properties is needed. Without this we cannot determine the
detailed requirements for excess heat production.

3.3.2. SEM and EDS characteristics:
Similar to our previous work [2,3], we also studied SEM as shown in Fig. 9, and element composition with EDS, as
shown in Tables 11 and 12 for different phases of Pd #16. Figure 9(a) is an SEM of the fresh sample and there is only
base metal Pd and some C and O on the surface (see Table 11). After heating in D2SO4 for 2 h, many microstructures
appear on the Pd surface as shown in Fig. 9(b). After electrolysis, new elements S, Ag and Pt occur on the surface
as shown in Fig. 9(c) and listed in Table 12. For these new elements, S comes from the electrolyte; Pt comes from

the anode and Ag may be the product of transmutation as reported before [2,3]. Spot #1 in Fig. 9(c) is the center of
a crater, where should be the place of deuterium bubbles evolved from and silver is prominent. This situation is the
same as Fig. 9 in [3]. This means that silver is transmuted in the deuterium electrode reaction.


4. Discussions and Conclusion

Although we can observe excess heat with some reproducibility, the amplitude of excess power is still very small now
and we need to increase it by 2 or 3 times at least. Otherwise, the scientific community may have doubts about the
calorimetry. Regarding the Pd surface pretreatment, we need more research to clarify the surface properties and their
physical effects. This may be the key step to amplifying excess power.

for (a) and (c), and 0.223 × 0.299 mm2
for (b); the units of height on the right side are in µm.

In conclusion, we find that high loading ratios of D/Pd are unnecessary for excess heat production in Pd|D2O
electrolytic cells. Additionally, the temperature is more important than the D/Pd ratio as demonstrated by 75 runs of
calorimetry. On the other hand, pretreatments of surface are another necessary step to activate Pd cathodes. Comparing
three methods, i.e. etching in aqua regia, heating in D2SO4 and open electrolyzing in D2SO4, we found that the latter
two are effective ways to activate a Pd sample to produce excess heat in subsequent electrolysis. Light and electron
microscopy indicate that pretreatments roughen the surface and this may be responsible for the excess heat production.
