1. Introduction

It is well established from experiments that (hydrogen or)
deuterium can be loaded in the Pd lattice even above the so-called
stoichiometric ratio, X = D/Pd = 0.7 (atoms of D per atom of Pd).
Up to this value (hydrogen or) deuterium atoms are arranged in the
lattice in the octahedral sites. A further increase in
concentration (or loading ratio) can be described by assuming
"guest" atoms delocalized arranged in shallow holes2 corresponding
to tetrahedal sites. The relative low energy barrier between two
tetrahedral sites brings out to describe this population as almost
free to move from a side to an other. We will refer only to D
atoms.

In the following we will quote from the current literature two
features of DPd compounds, showing that the D atoms exceeding the
stoichiometric ratio have a very different kind of interaction with
the lattice.

- It has been observed 3, 4 that the diffusion coefficient of D in
Pd increases steeply by almost two orders of magnitude above X=0.7.
This effect can be explained by assuming that the energy variation, 
required for an atom to move from a lattice site to another, 
decreases as the concentration increases. The diffusion coefficient 
follows the Arrenius law 

D a D0exp(-E/kT) 

where E is the energy barrier between two neighbour sites. Thus, 
the experimental data can be explained by assuming that the barrier 
is lowered when X exceeds 0.7. 

- It is known 5,6 that the relative change of volume (�V/V) of the
Pd lattice cell as a function of loading ratio is a straight line,
which shows a change in slope approximately at X = 0.7. This means
that, for concentrations higher than this, the interaction between
the D atoms and the Pd lattice changes.

These two features prompted us to propose a picture, in which 
the D atoms in the Pd lattice can be divided in two groups: 
localized atoms in the octahedral sites, and delocalized ones in 
the tetrahedral sites. The two groups have different kinds of 
interaction with the lattice. It has to be remembered that, even 
when X > 0.7, both groups are present: but, statistically, the 
delocalized fraction is negligible if octahedral sites are 
available, the latter's energy level being lower than for 
tetrahedral sites. 

The model describes the behaviour of the latter population 
than it assumes a Pd lattice in which the octahedral sites are 
already filled. Since the particles are indistingushable exchanges 
between two population doesn't modifie the system status. 


2. The model

Many experiments show that, when electrolytically charging D 
in Pd, the production of anomalous heat excess can be detected, if 
the loading ratio is in the range 0.8 - 1, or even larger. A 
typical feature of the first experiments was the need for a long 
pre-charging procedure, as long as weeks, or even months, in order 
for the anomalous effect to appear. More recently a pulsed 
technique has been used7, consisting in either applying a sawtooth 
current (just at the beginning of the run), or alternating low 
currents to high currents with long periods ("lo-hi" technique), 
resulting in a much more efficient charging mechanism. This 
behaviour pushed us to study, from a theoretical point of view, the 
loading and the transport dynamics of Din Pd, for X > 0.7, in the 
framework of hi-lo electrolysis. 

The model considers the Pd cathode as a membrane (with very 
high surface/thickness ratio), separating two regions. Two 
different instances have been considered: 

A. The cathode is totally immersed in an electrolytic cell,

B. Only one of the sides of the cathode participates to
electrolysis, while the other is exposed to an ambient containing
D2 gas.

It is well known that, during electrolysis, a strong electric 
field is present at the cathode-electrolyte interface. Furthermore, 
it is reasonable to assume a Thomas-Fermi like interaction between 
delocalized D atoms. Actually a dependence from the D 
concentration of the electronic shield has been assumed. We can 
then write an expression for the atom flow, depending both on 
concentration and local electric field: 

Fz•E 
J = - D(VC + --C) 
RT 

where: 
D diffusion coefficient, F Faraday constant, E total local 
electric field, C deuterium concentration , R gas constant, T 
temperature. 

The local electric field can be considered as the algebraic 
sum of the applied electric field (due to electrolysis) and the 
reactional field due to the Thomas-Fermi like potential. The former 
is non-zero only at the cathode-electrolyte interface, while the 
latter can be calculated as a function of the loading ratio. Then. 
the mass transfer equation, in transient conditions, can be written 
as: 

ac 
Fz• 
- =DV2C +-EVC
at 
RT 

where: z* effective deuteron charge 
(electrotransport)B-9. 
where C is the concentration of delocalized deuterons, R is the gas 
constant, F is the Faraday constant, T is the temperature, and Eis 
the local electric field. 

The interaction potential between delocalized deuterons (in 
the Thomas-Fermi picture) is: 

q 
r 
4> = --exp (- -)
4m:
0r 
AD 

where r is the distance between a delocalized deuteron and the 
first neighbour (proportional to 1/N1/3), 
AD is the Debye 
distance, and q is the electric charge. 

The initial and boundary conditions are: 
t

Where: 2ts is the period of the pulsed electrolysis, C1 e C2 are 
the surface concentration, on the electrolysis side, in low and 
high current respectively10. 

Condition (a) describes the electrolysis side of the 
electrode, condition 
(b) describes an electrode having one side in 
D gas ambient, condition (c) points a symmetric electrolysis (the 
membrane cathode is between two equal anodic plates). 

In order to evaluate the flow, in the gas (JDESIADS) it is
necessary to write down a mass balance. Since the flow is a 
function of the surface concentration and of the deuterons 
concentration in the gas phase, we can write: 

acSUP 
� = KADSCGAS - KDESCSUP + JDIFF 

where 
ac 
J DIFF = - D ax ; (x = L)

KDES and KADS are the desorption and adsorption constants 
respectively, CGAS and CsuP are the D concentration on the gas 
phase cathode side and in the gas bulk respectively. The 
desorption rate has been approximated as a lumped first order 
kinetic. 

The gas flux from/towards the cathode produces a variation of 
the number of D molecules in the gas phase producing a pressure 
variation: 

aP 
RT aNGAS 
at 
V 
at 

where Pis the gas pressure, Vis the gas volume and NGAS is the 
number of D molecules within the gas (ideal behaviour is assumed). 

The D concentration variation in the gas is: 

acGAS 
1 aP 
at 
RT at 

The model just described has been solved numerically by 
finite-difference method. For the adsorption/desorption constants, 
data from the literature have been used. 


3. Results and conclusions

The main features emerging from this model are the following: 


1. The period (2ts) of hi-lo electrolysis affects the charging
efficiency and the concentration profile (see Fig.1): with a proper
period, strong concentration gradients are set up. 

Figure 1. Concentration evolution in two contiguous slabs near the 
cathode surface in the electrolysis side. Profile in b) has been 
obtained with a period 4 times shorter than the one of a) case. 

Figure 2. Concentration profiles
evolution in two contiguous slabs
near the cathode surface exposed to
D2 gas. The perturbation simulates
the inversionof the flow on the gas
side. 

2. A strong external electric field enhances the charging efficien­
cy and the global loading ratio: it has been observect6 that an
increase in the potential across the cell (at constant current)
announces the production of heat excess.

3. The inversion of flow on the gas side produces a compression on
the delocalized deuterons (see Fig.2), and the rate of loading is
increased.

The experiments performed at ENEA/Frascatil show that a strong 
D2 gas adsorption is detected when heat excess is produced. Thus, 
the model gives a satisfying description of the diffusion of 
deuterons in a Pd cathode under electrochemical loading: it was 
possible to establish a correlation between the deuterium dynamics 
within the cathode and the production of heat excess: the model 
analysis leads to the following consideration concerning the 
development of excess of heat oriented experiments. The electrode 
surface should be maintained active from the absorption point of 
view and an "ad hoc" poisoning on the surface, aimed to reduce the 
deuterium recombination and/or to enhance the cathodic over­
potential, should be studied. In the geometry of the cell, 
particular care should be given to the evaluation of the currents 
distribution.
