1. Introduction

We have recently been pursuing calculations of neutron yields due to the presence of fast alphas and deuterons in PdD
and D2O, in order to better understand the relative absence of neutrons in excess heat experiments. In the course of our
calculations, we needed a fit for the deuteron–deuteron fusion cross section for neutron production. The cross sections
are available online in the Los Alamos ENDFB-VI nuclear data compilation. A table of them can be downloaded [1].
However, for numerical work it is useful to have a simple fitted version. After searching for a while in the literature,
it seemed worthwhile to develop fits that were useful for our purposes. Perhaps these may also be useful for others as
well.

We note that Li and coworkers have put forth a simple physics-based model for the deuteron–deuteron fusion cross
section [2], which from our perspective represents a major step forward. The parameterizations that we present here
are not intended to be physics-based fits; instead, we were interested in developing a more standard numerical type of
fit.

2. Parameterization of the cross section

At low energy, the asymptotic dependence of the fusion cross section in the absence of anomalous screening can be
found in terms of a constant astrophysical S-factor S0 according to
where we have indicated the relative energy as Er. The relative energy for the deuteron–deuteron reaction is half of the
incident deuteron energy E in the lab frame. The Gamow energy is
To develop a parameterization, we follow the approach of Erba [3], which is based on the energy-dependent astrophysical
S-factor S(E)
It is much easier to ﬁt this function than the cross section.

2.1. Fitting function:
To proceed, we adopt a ﬁtting function of the form

2.2. Fitting parameters for the 2H(2H,n)3He reaction:
In the case of the 2H(2H,n)3He reaction, we have obtained ﬁtting parameters given by
a = 10.8947,
b = 34.5732 MeV−1,
c = 0.254611 MeV−2,
d = 2.6419 MeV−1.
The S(E) function derived from the ENDFB-VI data set is shown along with the ﬁtted version of the function in
Fig. 1. The units of S associated with the ﬁt are barns eV.

2.3. Fitting parameters for the 2H(2H,p)3H reaction:
For the 2H(2H,p)3H reaction, the ﬁtting parameters that we found are
a = 10.921,
b = 22.5417 MeV−1,
c = 0.150056 MeV−2,
d = 1.71503 MeV−1.

The S(E) function derived from the ENDFB-VI data set is shown along with the ﬁtted version of the function in Fig. 2

3. More complicated ﬁtting function

It is possible to develop a better ﬁt using a similar ﬁtting function with more ﬁtting parameters. In this case, we adopt
a ﬁtting function of the form
In the case of the 2H(2H,n)3H reaction, the ﬁtting parameters we found are
a = 10.8757,
b = 51.579 MeV−1,
c = 24.822 MeV−2,
d = 0.070247 MeV−3,

Comparison of data with ﬁts; Er is the relative deuteron-deuteron
energy; S(n) is the astrophysical S-factor S(Er) for the 2H(2H,n)3H reaction
from the ENDFB-VI library; S4(n) is the 4-parameter ﬁtted result and S6(n)
is the 6-parameter ﬁtted result; S(p) is the astrophysical S-factor S(Er) for the
2H(2H,p)3H reaction from the ENDFB-VI library; S4(p) is the 4-parameter ﬁtted
result and S6(p) is the 6-parameter ﬁtted result.

e = 4.1407 MeV−1,
f = 1.8212 MeV−2.

For the 2H(2H,p)3H reaction, we obtained
a = 10.9070,
b = 32.995 MeV−1,
c = 5.2903 MeV−2,
d = − 0.050120 MeV−3,
e = 2.6291 MeV−1,
f = 0.34445 MeV−2.


4. Discussion

We have developed simple ﬁts to the deuteron–deuteron fusion cross sections which provide a reasonable match to the
ENDFB-VI data set. Numerical values for the two cross sections and the different ﬁts at selected relative energy points
are given in Table 1. One can see that the ﬁts match the data within a couple of percent. The standard error for the six
parameter ﬁts in both cases are about 60% of the standard error for the four parameter ﬁts.
