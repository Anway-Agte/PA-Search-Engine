Background

While planning our experiment we proceeded
from the following :
1. cold nucleus fusion should be uninterrupted,
2. experiment should be performed at high
temperature to increase a rate of deuterium
diffusion in metal,
3. deuterium flow should be orientated in one
direction.
The performance of the experiment in
deuterium gas phase provides all these
conditions. Since the process occurs on the
metal surface the reaction displays more
evidently at diffusion of deuterium through
a membrane. Glow discharge on one side of
the membrane creates orientated deuterium
flow.


Scheme of a device

The Pd foil with prepared structure is
positioned hermetically in a tube out of
stainless steel which is installed in a furnace
providing heating up to T= 1000 C.

After vacuumization the balloon was filled
by deuterium P<0,07 MPa. Discharge I=40 ma, U=350 v was
energized.


EXPERIMENT

Discharge was off in 42 hours after the onset.
Gas in a steel balloon (100 ml) was used for making
a mass spectrometric analysis.
The amount of 4He is on the background level.
Ti powder 3 g in weight absorbs the remaining gas
to analyze tritium.
Tritium was measured by scintillation method, the
total concentration was N>109 units.
No threshold crossing of neutron and gamma quanta
has been registered during the experiment. 
Change in temperature nearby of Pd membrane
Temperature fluctuation in 36 hours after
discharge on.
Energy distribution of tritium solution


CONCLUSION 

The device for generating heat and tritium is proposed.
Heat fluctuation has been registered (Î”T=4-5
0 C).
The increase in tritium concentration has been registered,
N>109 units .
Low energy reaction in deuterium medium occurs via the
tritium channel.
