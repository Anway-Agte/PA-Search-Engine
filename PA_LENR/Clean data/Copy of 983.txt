Introduction

In many experimental papers [1,2] concerning the behaviour of certain systems consisting of
metals, like palladium or nickel, highly loaded with hydrogen isotopes, it is stated that low
levels of nuclear radiation have been detected, which suggests the existence of very low rate
nuclear reactions in condensed mater. The possibility of nuclear reactions in condensed matter
is commonly denied, because the Coulomb barrier between two approaching hydrogen
isotope nuclei is impenetrable at very low energies. The energy fluctuations of the deuterons
are analysed further on.


The computed energy distribution

The cteuteron trapped in the metallic lattice will interact with the ions in the elementary cell
where it is located, as a general rule. Still, some metals like palladium present a very high
value for the diffusion constant. The high values are explained by Bush in the frame of the
TRM model [3, 4], involving a solid state effect produced by the periodical potential barriers,
which makes the deuteron to "flow" resonantly through them, for certain values of the
velocity.  

With this considerations, a deuteron has been considered to interact with the ions of the 
metallic lattice through elastic collision in one dimension, therefore the shape of the screened 
coulomb barrier does not change the results. The number of the ions the deuteron collides has 
been considered to be larger then the number of the low order neighbours, because the 
deuteron travels through the metal, as explained in (3, 4]. 

A number of 63981 target ions have been considered to form the statistical collection. First 
the energy range between 0 and 9k6 T has been divided in 1000 intervals and the number of 
ions having the energy in each interval has been computed, so that they obey a Maxwell 
distribution for their velocities. Then the energy of each target ion has been registered in a 
file. 

The deuteron has been considered to have an initial energy of 3ks T/2, where ks is the 
Boltzman's constant and T the temperature of the presumed sample, and it collides the target 
ions in a succession chosen randomly by the computer, which makes this simulation to be of a 
Monte - Carlo type. The target energy after the elastic collision in one dimension has been 
considered as the initial target energy in the next collision of the deuteron with that particular 
ion and has been recorded back in the file. The deuteron velocity and energy after each 
collision have been recorded in another file and considered as the energy and velocity for the 
next collision. The total number of collisions of the deuteron with the target ions was 
1279620, so that, as an average, each target ion has been collided twenty times. 


Energy fluctuations 

During the computer experiment the values of the energy of the deuteron have been 
recorded after every collision. Ifwe define an energy fluctuation to be the sequence when the 
deuteron has a higher energy then Emm and is remains so over the time of at least Nmin
collisions, it can be identified from the record of the values of the energy of the deuterons 
after each collision. The number Nn of the energy fluctuations which occurred during the 
computer experiment concerning collisions with ions having the mass number A=I00, for 
several values of the above-mentioned parameters, are presented in the table I. 

As expected, the number of fluctuations occurring in a system containing deuterium and 
ions with a larger atomic number, is lower as the lower energy limit considered for the 
fluctuation is higher and as the minimum time considered for the fluctuation to be counted is 
larger. Still, accordingly to the first row of the table, over at least 353*200 collisions the 
deuteron presented a kinetic energy higher than 1.55 eV, which means more 5.5% of the 
whole time. 

Table I 


Discussions 

The simple model presented in this article predicts the existence of the energy fluctuations for 
a considerable time inteival. A more realistic model, considering realistic collisions between 
the deuteron and the target ions have been published [8], and the prediction of energy 
fluctuations is also stated. Still, it would be premature to use the energy distribution predicted 
by the simple model presented here in assessing the low energy nuclear reaction rates in 
condensed matter. 

It is worth noticing that in condensed matter nuclear reactions are produced in a different 
manner because the nuclei approach in a rich negative charge environment. If the metallic 
lattice is loaded with deuterium at a loading ratio close to 1, as the sample is electrically 
neutral, for each deuteron an electron is added to the sample, therefore the concentration of 
the ''free" electrons in the conduction band should be considered to be double relative to the 
normal one [9]. As it has been presented in many published works like [5 - 7], the electrons 
are screening the Coulomb barrier of the two approaching nucle� which considerably 
increases the barrier penetration probability. 

The effect of the energy fluctuations, combined with a considerable increase of the 
Coulomb barrier penetration probability might lead to a very low and unsteady rate of low 
energy nuclear reactions produced by the hydrogen isotopes in condensed matter, in the 
classical known manner. 

It must be underlined that the nuclear reactions "catalysed" by the rich electron 
environment, presenting a very low rate, enhanced by the energy fluctuations, are not 
responsible for the low energy nuclear transmutations and for the excess energy reported in 
many experimental papers [l] but they can be the source of the very low levels of nuclear 
radiation which accompany the processes, still incompletely understood, connected with 
hydrogen isotopes loaded in certain metals at very high ratios.

ABOUT DEUTERIUM NUCLEAR REACTION RATE IN CONDENSED MATTER 


Introduction 

The announcement of Drs. Fleischman and Pons, early in March 1989, that nuclear fusion 
reaction between deuterium nuclei occurred at the room temperature [ 1] marked the 
beginning of a long saga. Thousands of experiments, of an ove1whelming variety [2], 
starting with the simple one to reproduce the electrolysis experiment and ending with 
complex multilayer cathodes, have been performed all over the world, in the effort to 
understand all the odd aspects of the phenomena, whose existence is no longer questioned 
[3]. Many articles like [4], [5], [6], [7], point out that nuclear transmutations should be 
associated with this peculiar behaviour. The possibility of two nuclei to undergo a nuclear 
reaction in condensed matter is analysed further on. 


The Nuclear Reaction Rate 

For the beginning the volume nuclear reaction rate of the bare deuterium nuclei trapped in 
a metallic lattice is assessed, in a simple manner, considering that half of them are incident 
toward the others /8/: 

where P(v) is Coulomb barrier penetration probability, PM(v) is the Maxwell distribution of
the deuterons, v is the velocity, and c
l the pre-exponential factor, as described in [8], where:

a0 = 10·24 cm2 for reactions (a,b) and a0 = 10·
30 cm2 for (a,y) 

The reaction rate has been integrated using a computer programme written for this
purpose. A value of the magnitude 10·211 reactions /m3·s has been found for the bare
deuterium nuclei. This cvasi-null reaction rate is obviously not detectable by any of the
available procedures; it is considered that the lower detectable limit for a nuclear reaction
rate is 10·3 cm·3.s·1 [8].


The Effect of th.e Electron Screening 

The approaching deuterium nuclei trapped in a metallic lattice will move towards each
other in a rich negative charge environment caused by the cvasi - free electrons in the
conduction energy band. A simple model to describe the screening effect of the Coulomb
barrier caused by the electrons in a metal is presented.

The Debye length 10 in a plasma is the size of the possible displacement of a layer of
electrons which moves aside from the layer of positive ions as the result of a fluctuation and
can be assessed by equalling the electric potential energy to the average thermal kinetic
energy. It can be found [9] that:

where k is the Boltzman' s constant, e the electric charge of the electron, no the "free"
electron concentration and Eo is the permittivity of the free space.

The potential used for the screened Coulomb barrier, inspired from [10], is plasma - like
screening potential, where the screening parameter is the Debye length. The screened
Coulomb potential between two approaching deuterons will be:

V(r)= e
•exp(-�) 
41l'e0r 
Iv 

where r is the distance between the nuclei and lo is the Debye length, given by [9]:

where k is the Boltzman' s constant, e the electric charge of the electron, no1he "free" electron
concentration and Eo is the permittivity of the free space. The effect of the increasing the
''free" electron concentration is to reduce the Debye length and therefore enhance the 
screening effect and increase the nuclear reaction rate. 

The penetration probability is strongly enhanced from 1 o-soo at thermal kinetic energy for 
the bare deuteron, to 10 
for a normal concentration of no = 6,25· 10 
m-3, which is the
''free" electron concentration in palladium 

It is worth noticing that that when a metal is loaded with hydrogen isotopes to a loading 
ration of one deuterium atom to one metal atom, as it is reported in many papers on the 
subject [l], because the sample is electrically neutral, the concentration of ''free" electrons is 
approximately double, so a value ofn0 = 1,25·10 m-3 should normally be considered in the 
calculations. Also it should be noted that higher ''free" electron concentration zones can exist 
near the surface of a metal which is the subject of a negative electric potential, due to the 
capacitor effect, as is presented in [11, 12]. 

The nuclear reaction rate of the deuterons encountering a screened electric potential in a 
metal's lattice, is assessed in the same manner as for the unscreened Coulomb potential, 
using ( 1 ), and the results are presented in table 1. 

Table 1 


Discussions 

The computed values of the nuclear reaction rate in condensed matter presented in the 
table reveal that the rate increases very fast with the ''free" electron concentration, actually it 
increases 106 times when the electron concentration doubles it's value from the normal one. 
Above all, the nuclear reaction rate predicted by this model can reach high enough values to 
be detectable, in certain regions where the electron concentration is high enough. 

The model strongly overestimates the nuclear reaction rate, because the screening 
parameter is very small and because it uses an approximation for the low energy reaction 
cross section, as presented in (2), therefore the results presented here should be considered 
only as a simple estimation of the reaction rates. With this in mind, it is worth noticing that 
the nuclear reactions at very low energies, in condensed matter, should be considered in a 
completely different manner than in free space between heavy ions, and that, in certain 
circumstances, for porous or grainy samples which are subject to a negative electric potential 
and are heavily loaded with deuterium, very low nuclear radiation level might be detected 
[11, 12]. Such regions with high electron concentrations can represent a significant part of 
the cathode volume in systems like the Miley - Patterson metal coated beads, either simple 
coated, represented by the layer near the surface where the excess negative electric charge is 
located in, or the multi-layer beads, where a region with high electron concentration exists at 
the contact between different metals due to the different Fermi levels [4 - 7]. 

The very low value of the nuclear reaction rate could stand for the very low tritium 
and neutron levels detected in some experiments, but not for the excess energy which 
accompanied the loading of deuterium in palladium or titanium, in many experiments [2].
