INTRODUCTION

The search for neutron emission due to the interaction between deuterium gas
and titanium in non-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions was first proposed by the
Frascati Group of ENEA, and preliminary results, obtained in April 1989, were
published 0). The same results, enriched with new data, were presented at the Santa
Fe Workshop on Cold Fusion Phenomena in May (2) and at the Workshop Understanding
Cold Fusion Phenomena, held in Varenna in September 1989 (3). These data, as well as
all the others in the field, were characterized by lack of reproducibility.

The first results were obtained by having titanium chips (produced with a lathe)
to interact with deuterium gas at pressures up to 60 bars. The system was then cycled
between liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) and room temperature. The neutrons were
detected, during warm-up, by a single BF3 moderated neutron detector, having a very
low efficiency (in the order of 10-4). The time structure of the neutron emission
appeared to be in "bursts", by burst meaning the emission of many neutrons in a time
comparable with the die-away time of the neutrons in the detector-moderator system
(typically a few tens of microseconds). We will refer to these first measurements as
to the first generation measurements.

At the Santa Fe Meeting similar results were presented by a Los Alamos Group,
led by H. Menlove (4), with two main improvements in the detection system. A much
higher efficiency was obtained (up to 45%) by using many 3He tubes in a cylindrical
geometry, and a peculiar technique was used to analyse the time structure of the
neutron emission. The latter can be shortly summarized (in a simplified way) as
follows: when a neutron is detected by the system, it is added in a register called
totals; at the same time, a time window (typically 128 µs) is opened, and the neutrons
detected in this window are summed up in a register called reals. The reals detected
give information about the neutrons emitted all together in a short time interval, i.e.,
the bursts. It can be easily shown that there is a simple relation between the number
of reals, R, and the corresponding number of neutrons detected in the burst, n: 

R = kn(n-1 )/2 

where k is an instrumental parameter of order 1. 

In the Autumn of 1989, in the light of the many contradictory results presented 
at the Santa Fe Meeting, we faced the dilemma of whether to try ta measure the 
energy of the neutrons, or to concentrate our efforts on the study of the time 
structure of the neutron emission, and possibly of the correlation between the neutron 
emission and the thermodynamic parameters of the system. The first route would 
have made impractical to study these two features. We decided to follow the second 
route, adopting the improvements to the instrumentation suggested by the Los 
Alamos Group. We ordered an ad hoc detector from Jomar (5), and in the meanwhile
we were able to borrow a standard Jomar detector (normally used for nuclear 
safeguard activities), with 15 active 3He tubes and an efficiency of about 15%. With
this instrument we performed a series of experiments, still in the Frascati Laboratory 
(FL), in the period November 1989-February 1990. In addition, in collaboration with 
the Ispra Center of Euratom, we started to look for tritium in titanium samples that 
had been treated with deuterium. The positive and encouraging results obtained in 
both types of measurements (neutron and tritium) were presented at the First Annual
Conference on Cold Fusion (b) in March 1990. We will refer to these measurements as to
the second generation experiments. 

In the Autumn 1990 we received our new detector. Furthermore we had become 
aware of the importance of reducing the neutron background in our measurements. 
Thus we had asked, and obtained, the hospitality of the INFN (Istituto Nazionale di 
Fisica Nucleare) in its underground laboratory under the Gran Sasso massif near 
L'Aquila [Laboratorio Nazionale del Gran Sasso (LNGS)]. After the first calibrations 
at Frascati, we moved at LNGS in Autumn, and started our measurements towards 
the end of the year. Preliminary data about the system and its calibration, and about 
the neutron background at LNGS, were presented at the Workshop on Anomalous Nuclear 
Effects in Deuterium-Solid Systems (7), held in Provo, Utah, USA in October 1990. Here
we are presenting the results of the first months of measurements performed with the 
new detector at LNGS, up to June 1991. We will refer to them as to the third 
generation experiments. We want to point out that the difficulties connected with the 
logistics of the experiment (LNGS is about 150 km from FL) had as a consequence a 
limited number of runs, meaning by runs the thermal cycles of deuterium gas­
titanium samples. Furthermore the first three to four months were dedicated to the 
search for a reproducible pretreatment of the samples, trying also procedures 
suggested (at the Provo Meeting) by other groups, in particular by the Los Alamos 
Group (M. Paciotti) (8) and a Beijing group (Prof. Zhu) (9). All the data referring to
these measurements will be reported here. We continued also the search for tritium in 
titanium-deuterium samples, with some positive results. 


THE NEUTRON MEASUREMENTS 

We refer to the communication presented at the Provo. Meeting (7) for the
details on the detector and its calibration, both at FL and at LNGS. Here we want 
only to remember that the detector is composed of an inner ring (IR) with 20 3He
tubes (efficiency 27%) and an outer ring (OR) with 8 3He tubes, all the tubes being
immersed in high density polyethylene; a veto counter (VC), permits to discard signals 
due to noise in the electric feed line. Another feature that we want to remember is 
the background of reals, which was about one per hour at FL, with values of R 
centred about 6; at LNGS, it was of one real, with R = 1, per week. 

Table 1 shows the list of tests on 18 samples, starting November 1990 and 
ending June 1991. After trying the Zhu's and the Paciotti's methods for pretreating 
the samples, without positive results, a method devised by us was chosen and used 
starting February 1991. We used the titanium alloy called 662 (6% vanadium, 6% 
aluminium, 2% tin), worked at the lathe in long threads 50 µm thick and 1 mm large. 
During the lathe cutting a flow of pure 4He gas was sent onto the contact point
between the tool and the metal, in order to favour the cooling down of the thread 
with as low as possible oxidation. The sample ( == 120 g) was then put into the 
experimental cell, and heated under vacuum up to about 100 'C for a couple of hours, 
and then let under vacuum while cooling down. Next day the cell was brought to 
LNGS. Here it was charged with Dz gas up to 20 bars, and then closed. The cell was 
then heated in an oven, while controlling pressure and temperature, until Dz gas was

absorbed, with a controlled rate of absorption, up to an average stoichiometric 
composition of the order of a few percent D atoms per Ti atom. Figure I shows the 
behaviour of a parameter indicating the absorption of deuterium as a function of time 
during this phase for samples C 10, C 12, C20 and Cl I, which were the only four for 
which the D2-charging procedure was rather comparable. The parameter is the ratio
between temperature (absolute) and pressure (in bars), normalized to the starting 
point. The steep part of the curves represents the absorption phase. When the desired

procedure was similar, are considered.

amount of Dz had been absorbed, the cell was taken out of the oven, and the 
parameter started to decrease. The maximum temperatures reached were between 
180 and 300 °C. At this point the sample was let to cool down to room temperature; 
then more Dz gas was added, bringing up the pressure typically to 30 bars, and the 
cell, closed, was immersed in liquid nitrogen, bringing it in a few minutes at 77 K. 
The last step was to put the cell immersed in a dewar full of liquid nitrogen in the 
sample well of the detector, leaving it alone for the next days, while the nitrogen 
evaporated and the sample's temperature increased; the neutron emission and the 
temperature were recorded. In order to reduce the dead time due to the transmission 
of data from the Jomar system to the memory of the computer, we decided to use a 
quite long measurement time interval, 1000 s. On Table 1 it is indicated that in three 
out of these four runs, and precisely for the samples ClO, Cl 2 and C21, a big burst 
was seen on the IR: the values of R are respectively 994, 2032 and 1134. The 
corresponding values of the totals were coherent with the equation quoted before; for

for the samples quoted in Fig.1. For samples C10, C12 and C21 a burst could be detected, both on 
the totals and on the reals: the value of R is reported. 

sample Cl2 the value of 2032 could be better explained with two bursts of R :::: 1000 
taking place in the same time interval. The veto counter showed no anomalies in 
these measurement intervals, confirming thus that the bursts could not be attributed 
to electric disturbance in the electric feed line. The only incoherent feature is the 
absence of corresponding reals in the OR; taking for good the calibration performed 
with the 252cf source (see (7)), one should have expected a value of R in the order of
10, but the value measured in correspondence with the IR bursts was always zero. In 
Fig. 2 the time evolution of the neutron emission (totals) and of the temperature of 
the sample is shown. The values of the reals for the three bursts are written close to 
the totals' bursts. The two changes in slope of the temperature curves presumably 
represent the instant in which the cell is no more in contact with liquid nitrogen, and 
then the moment in which all liquid nitrogen is evaporated. 

Concluding, we have presented an experiment performed in particularly clean 
conditions, both for the good quality of the detector and for the particularly low level 
of the neutron background (note that in the LNGS the ambient conditions are 
outstanding: temperature is constant at about 20 °C and humidity is quite low, less 
than 40%). We have found three events (bursts) in four runs which were characterized 
by quite similar procedures in preparing the sample. The bursts corresponded to about 
200 source neutrons, but the absence of countings on the OR sets a doubt on this 
evidence. In order to explain it, one should imagine that the neutrons detected are of 
energy much lower than the 2.5 MeV expected from a D-D fusion reaction: in this 
case the calibration with 252cf would be no more valid. On the other side it is
striking that the three bursts are characterized by very similar experimental 
features, such as: 

- similar pretreatment of the sample

- similar temperature range of the event (-160 to -120 °C, while warming up)

- coherent relation between totals and reals

- negative signature of the VC, excluding electric noise.

Experiments on this line will continue, trying to optimize the pretreatment of 
the sample, and to increase the frequency of the runs. 

Another improvement will consist in adding, in parallel to the Jomar shift-register, 
another system for collecting the countings, which will record each of them with its 
date, i.e., the indication of the absolute time of arrival of the detected neutron, with 
the accuracy of 0.5 µs (10). The comparison between the two registrations will permit 
a more thorough comprehension of the events (reals). 


SEARCH FOR TRITIUM 

The technique used to look for tritium absorbed in the titanium samples has 
been described elsewhere (11). Here we will recall the main features. The titanium
sample, on which deuterium, and presumably tritium, is absorbed, is put in an oven at 
1000 °C under a flow of 4He gas, so that all the hydrogen isotopes are desorbed. The
flowing gas passes through a CuO catalyst at 400 °C, where the hydrogen isotopes are 
transformed in water vapours. Then it passes through two water scrubbers (containers 
with distilled water), set in series and kept at the temperature of 4 °C, where the 
vapours are condensed and mixed up with the water of the scrubbers. Part of the 
content of the scrubbers is then examined with a scintillation spectrometer, and the 
presence of tritium is detected. 

Part of the samples of the third generation of experiments have been partially 
examined (not all the � 120 g of titanium used for the neutron experiments have been 
subjected to the procedure described above). The amount of tritium contained 

Table 2 The amount of tritium found in titanium samples Cl­
C 13, expressed in Bq/g (becquerel per gram of 
deuterium desorbed from the sample). The amount of 
tritium contained in the original deuterium gas (9.3 
Bq/g) has been subtracted. Only part of each sample 
has been subjected to this measurement. The error in 
the measurement is 0.5 Bq/g. 

originally in the Dz gas was accurately measured, and, for the two bottles used in the 
measurements quoted, it was "" 9 Bq/g of deuterium. The results of the third 
generation measurements are reported in Table 2 (the value of the tritium contained 
originally in the gas has been subtracted). The values are not high, but the accuracy 
of the measurements is quite good; thus they can be considered meaningful. 


OTHER EXPERIMENTS 

The experiments described here, from the first to the third generation, show 
clearly the difficulty of defining accurately the parameters that characterize the 
material used and its treatment, including Dz absorption. The need for a better 
characterized system is strongly felt. Thus, while still continuing the measurements 
described here, we decided to start a new line, inspired by the work of Zelensky, 
Rybalko et al. (12), i.e., the study of titanium thin layers on which deuterium has been 
implanted at low temperature (typically 77 °K), thus creating locally a very high 
concentration of deuterium, then heating up the sample, in order to create non­
equilibrium conditions, while looking for the emission of neutrons and charged 
particles. We hope to perform this experiment at LNGS, where the very low neutron 
background _ should permit quite favourable experimental conditions for neutron 
detection. The main aim of such an experiment is to be able to obtain an 
experimental procedure with a much better reproducibility. Preliminary tests for this 
kind of experiment have been started.
