1. Introduction

Excess heat has been observed in many Fleischmann-Pons experiments over the years, generally
supporting the claims made by Fleischmann and Pons in 1989 [1,2]. The many negative results found in
the early experiments of 1989 can be attributed in part to a lack of understanding of basic requirements
that were clarified later on [3-5]. A remarkable feature of the effect is that a prodigious amount of energy
is produced; much greater than can be attributed to chemical reactions (for which physical evidence is
absent). The conjecture that the energy is due to a new nuclear process has historically been met with
much skepticism, due to the absence of commensurate energetic particles which would be expected if
nuclear reactions were responsible [6]. In a nuclear reaction, the energy produced is expressed as
energetic particles as a consequence of local energy and momentum conservation. Excess energy
produced in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment without commensurate energetic particles challenges long
established ideas about how nuclei react, suggesting that there is a new kind of physical process in which
nuclei interact in some new way in which the energy is expressed through other degrees of freedom.

We have described in earlier publications a new mechanism which is capable of coherent energy
exchange between two-level systems and an oscillator under conditions where the transition energy of the
two-level system is a great many times the characteristic energy of the oscillator [7,8]. This mechanism
seems to be capable of converting an MeV-level nuclear energy quantum into a very large number of
meV-level phonons under conditions relevant to the Fleischmann-Pons experiment. We have proposed a
two-step reaction mechanism that involves first the transfer of excitation from the hindered D2/4He
system to unhindered two-level systems which then convert the nuclear energy quantum to phonons using
this new energy conversion mechanism. Under conditions where the excitation transfer step is the
"bottleneck" which determines the overall rate for the two-step reaction, the reaction rate can be estimated
from the associated excitation transfer matrix element. We have recently computed the nuclear part of
this matrix element using a brute force numerical calculation, and we find that it is sufficiently large to
account for the rate of excess heat production if the screening energy [9] is about 150 eV.

For the process consistent with our model to occur, molecular D2 must be present in the lattice. In this
respect, our model differs from other models which are currently more popular [10,11]. In our view,
many practical aspects of the Fleischmann-Pons experiment and related experiments can be understood in
terms of maximizing molecular D2 inside the lattice. In this proceedings paper, we will focus on the issue
of D2 in PdD, which will focus our attention on issues related to the local electron density and vacancies.


2. Preferred electron density

Our arguments in this paper are based on the notion (from embedded atom theory [12-14]) that there
exists a preferred electron density that deuterium or dideuterium wants to see, that is similar in molecular
or solid state environments. If so, then we might use PdH as a reference for deuterium in Pd, and PdH2 as
a reference for dideuterium in Pd.

In the case of PdH, we make use of the results of Balasubramanian et al [15] who give an atomic
separation of 1.53 Angstroms. For PdH2, we use the results of Balasubramanian et al [16], who give an a
separation between the Pd atom and the center of the H2 molecule to be 1.67 Angstroms. In this case, the
two hydrogen atoms bond as a molecule with a separation of 0.81 Angstroms. To estimate the Pd
electron density at 1.67 Angstroms for PdH2, we performed a Dirac-Fock calculation for atomic Pd in the
ground state (4d)10 configuration (which was found by Balasubramanian et al to be the dominant Pd
configuration), and found the Pd electron density to be 0.0332 electrons/Angstrom3 (see Figure 1). A
similar computation for the Pd (4d)9.35(5s)0.65 configuration leads to an electron density at 1.53 Angstroms
of 0.0686 electrons/Angstrom3.

3.  Pd electron density in PdH 

If we consider the electron density due to only the Pd atoms in PdH from a simple superposition of the 
atomic orbitals, we obtain the result for a scan centered at an octahedral site along the [111] direction 
shown in Figure 2.  We see that the electron density is lowest at the octahedral site in this model, with a 
density of 0.081 electrons/Angstrom3.  The electron density in this model is significantly higher at the 
tetrahedral sites, indicating that one would expect hydrogen in PdH to occupy the octahedral sites since 
the Pd electron density at these sites is closer to the Pd electron density in molecular PdH. 

A computation of H2 in electron gas at an electron density of 9.3x10-3 electrons/a0
3 was published by 
Christensen et al [17].  This electron density corresponds to 0.0628 electrons/Angstrom3, and is 
reasonably close to the octahedral site electron density in PdH from above (0.081 electrons/Angstrom3). 
The equilibrium distance between the two hydrogen atoms in this case is about 1.9 a0, which is 1.005 
Angstroms.  This perhaps provides the closest connection to the discussion above.  The electron density 
once again is higher than in the case of -bonded PdH2, and the H2 molecule responds by increasing its 
separation because of the occupation of antibonding states. 


4.  Electron density near a monovacancy in PdH 

We next consider the electron density due Pd atoms near a monovacancy in PdH.  In Figure 3 we show 
the Pd electron density from a simple superposition of Pd atomic orbitals, where the vacancy is indicated 
at -3.54 Angstroms, and where the along the [111] direction the electron density is equal to the preferred 
electron density of molecular H2. 

Fig. 3. – Model electron density due to Pd near a monovacancy in PdH. 

We note that this model gives an electron density at the octahedral site location near the vacancy to be 
very close to the optimum for single H as judged by the PdH molecule.  The calculation of Velikova et al 
[18] is consistent with a displacement of 0.26 Angstroms for single H occupation from the octahedral site 
location. 


5.  Statistical mechanics 

To estimate the probability that a D2 molecule is present in a monovacancy, we require a statistical model.  
Binding energies for single hydrogen atoms in octahedral sites have been estimated by several authors, 
including Nordlander et al [14] and Velikova et al [18].  The binding energies of Velikova et al are 
relative to hydrogen in solution at low concentration, which suggests that we need consistent models for 
deuterium in the bulk and trapped in vacancies.  We begin with the bulk model, where the chemical 
potential can be related to the loading above the beta phase boundary through 

Here ED(0)  is the deuterium binding energy in dilute PdDx; the variable x is the D/Pd ratio; and E is the 
binding energy at D/Pd = 0.60 minus the binding energy at D/Pd=0.  We have used E = -135 meV [19], 
and  
This is consistent with the measurements of Chun and Ra [20].   

Fig. 4. – Model calclation of occupation of D2 near monovacancies. 

For the occupation of the octahedral sites in the vicinity of a vacancy, we can use a model based on 
For the degeneracy gm, we have included the spin and statistical factors; for the energies Em, we have used 
the results of Velikova et al [18].  From the computations in [18], we know that a dideuterium molecule is 
unstable in the presence of unoccupied octahedral sites in the vicinity of a monovacancy.  So we have 
added the possibility of D2 occupation only when there are 7 deuterons in the vicinity of the 
monovacancy.  This is consistent with the computations of Liu et al for hydrogen in W [21].  In the 
D/Pd
xD2
calculation of Velikova et al, the energy of the D2 molecule is about 1 eV above deuterium atom 
occupation of the octahedral sites.  Unfortunately, we do not as yet have a good number for the D2 energy 
relative to bulk deuterium for 5D+D2 occupation around a monovacancy.  In the computation shown in 
Figure 4, we have assumed that the additional D has to go up by 200 meV from ED(0) to make a D2 
molecule. 

The amount of D2 in this model increases with loading above a threshold near 0.85.  We recall that the 
excess heat increases with loading above a threshold in much the same way.  This is consistent with 
models that we have put forth which start with D2 in the lattice as a prerequisite for the reactions which 
result in excess power and 4He. 


6.  Conclusions 

Excess heat in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment has been seen in a large number of experiments.  At 
present there is no consensus among those in the field as to what physical mechanism is responsible.  Our 
attention over the past decade has been focused on new reaction mechanisms which are driven by D2 to 
4He transitions, with the energy converted into phonon excitation.  For this reaction mechanism to work, 
we require D2 to be present in the lattice, which is not an easy thing to happen if the lattice is PdD.  

Molecular D2 cannot form in bulk PdD because the electron density is too high.  According to the 
arguments here, D2 can form near vacancies, and we have focused on the occurrence of D2 near a 
monovacancy.  Since the electron density due to Pd is reduced near the site of a missing Pd atom, the 
electron density in our simple models drops to levels at which D2 normally binds to Pd. 
We have been of the opinion for many years now that important aspects of the Fleischmann-Pons 
experiment can be understood simply if we are trying to maximize D2 occupation.  Since D2 doesn't form 
in bulk PdD, and since there are very few vacancies initially in Pd, the cathodes start out with essentially 
no ability to host molecular D2.  So, according to the discussion above, we need to create vacancies.  
Vacancies are stabilized when Pd is highly loaded with deuterium [22-23].  Previously we estimated that 
a D/Pd loading of about 0.95 was required in order for the vacancies to become favored 
thermodynamically.  However, since the diffusion coefficient for vacancies is so small near room 
temperature, vacancies have great difficulty diffusing in from nearby surfaces.  Instead, it seems more 
probable that inadvertent codeposition of Pd on highly loaded Pd is responsible.  This is consistent with 
observations of impurities below the outer surface of cathodes, and it is consistent with the very long time 
that cathodes need to remain loaded prior to observations of excess power.  Codeposition has been 
verified as being able to produce superabundant vacancies [24].  The short onset time of excess power in 
the Szpak experiment is consistent with this point of view.  Vacancies in this scenario would be created 
near the outer surface, so that only the near-surface region would be active.  This is consistent with the 
observation of produce 4He in the gas phase, which could not diffuse if created in the interior. 

Once vacancies have been produced, then they need to be filled with molecular D2.  According to the 
model described above, this requires high loading above D/Pd of about 0.85.  The correlation between 
loading and excess power has been observed in experiments [3], and the results are consistent if one 
assumes that the level of excess power production is correlated with D2 occupancy.  It remains to 
compute the D2 binding energy in a monovacancy with 7 deuterium atoms present.
