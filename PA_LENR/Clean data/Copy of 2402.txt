1. Introduction

9 years after the first announcement of "excess heat" in D/Pd system, it is still a
controversial subject: if there is really "excess heat" in D/Pd system. One of the uncertainties
is essentially related to the electrolytic system as a deuterium-loading system. There must be a
power input in order to electrolyze the heavy water; hence, we have to have a good calibration
of the calorimetric system in order to deduct this input power. This calibration restricts the
range of scrutiny in parameter searching, and inhibits the detection of"excess heat".

Is there any way to have the qualitatively conclusion about "excess heat" without any
restriction due to calibration? i.e. Can we extract a conclusion about "excess heat" without the
exact value of heat transfer coefficient? Yes, it is possible in a gas-loading system. There is
essentially no power input in a gas-loading system because there is no need of electrolysis.
Then, any heat generated in the system may be attributed to "excess heat". We made two
identical calorimetric systems, and compared their temperatures when they were filled with
deuterium gas or hydrogen gas, respectively. We found that the temperature of deuteriumloaded palladium wire was always higher than that of hydrogen-loaded wire[l]. It was the
evidence of the "excess heat" in palladium deuteride, because we have shown that the
calorimetric features are same for these two identical calorimetric systems. The observed
values for the heat transfer coefficient are essentially same (ko=(4.18±0.03)xl04 sec·1
,k8 =(4.24±0 .04)xl0·4 sec·1)[1]. In this case, the exact value of heat transfer coefficient is less
important than the equality of these two coefficients.

To avoid any suspicion of the calibration between two calorimetric systems, we completed
two additional sets of experiments:(!) In the same deuterium-loaded palladium wire system,
we compared its calorimetric feature in the normal and anomalous cases; (2) In the same
calorimetric system, we compared its calorimetric feature when it was filled with hydrogen or
deuterium gas, respectively. Both sets of experiments showed that there was "excess heat" in
the palladium deuteride


2. "Excess Heat" in Deuterium-loaded Palladium Wire System

The temperature inside a dewar, T(D), is monitored in parallel with the temperature outside
the dewar, T(W). A long and thin (250cm x ¢0.34mm) palladium wire was mounted on a
quartz frame in this dewar. After the long run of deuterium gas-loading in palladium wire, two
different calorimetric behaviors were observed. Fig. 1 shows the normal case. The temperature
inside this dewar(T(D)) follows the temperature outside the dewar (T(W)) as expected. When
T(W)>T(D), T(D) increase; when T(W)<T(D), T(D) decreases. Of course, when T(W)=T(D),
T(D) does not change with time (t), i.e. the derivative of T(D) with respect to time, dT(D)
,dt equals 0. In other word, two curves of temperature, T(D) and T(W), intercept at the 
maximum and minimum points of T(D). This is exactly the behavior shown in Fig. I. This
behavior meant that there was no heat source inside that dewar. It also gives us the confidence
about the calibration of these two thermometers.

However, there was another behavior in the same calorimetric system. Fig.2 shows this
anomalous behavior. These two curves of temperature, T(D) and T(W), do not intercept at
the maximum and minimum points of T(D). It was clearly shown that the temperature inside
the dewar, T(D), kept going up while T(D) was higher than T(W) in the period of 1-2, 3-4,
5-6 in Fig.2. This behavior violates the second law of thermodynamics unless there is a heat
source inside the dewar. This experiment has been reproduced in the new calorimetric system
as follows.


3. "Excess Heat" in New Calorimetric System

A new calorimetric system was built with two features:(!) Instead of the water-bath
thermostat in section 2, a big air-convection bath was built. Two electrical fans were installed 
in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively, in order to make the temperature of air 
more uniform; (2) The temperature of air around the dewar might be controlled by computer 
to vary as a pre-set function of time, Tw(t). In Fig.3 the dewar, which was used in section 2, 
was put in the big air-bath thermostat. The electrical power in the heater was controlled by 
computer, and might enhance the temperature, Tw(t), to 70 Deg.C. The Tw(t) might be 
maintained as a constant with the accuracy better 
than 0.02 Deg.C, or Tw(t) might drop as a linear

be set as a constant. Usually we set the computer 
program to make the temperature, T(D), up and 
down along a straight line with the cycle period of 6 
hours or 2 days. The hydrogen gas was filled into 
the dewar first. The resistance and temperature of 
the palladium wire inside the dewar were monitored 
to measure the loading ratio, H/Pd (atomic ratio). In 
the following experiments, the loading ratio(H/Pd) 
was about 0. 11 during the temperature cycle. In 
Fig.4 , two curves of temperature, T(H) and T(W), 
intercept at the points where T(H) reaches its 
maximum or minimum. It confirms the calibration 
of the thermometers in this calorimetric system.

Fig.5 T(D)(-) and T(W)(-) don't intercept at the minimum and the maximum points of T(D) 
Then, the hydrogen gas was pumped out by mechanical pump and diffusive pump while 
palladium wire was heated up to 350 Deg.C for several hours. Deuterium gas was then filled 
into the dewar, and we run the same temperature cycle as that for hydrogen/palladium system. 

In Fig.5 two curves of temperature, T(D) and T(W), do not intercept at the points where T(D) 
reaches its maximum and minimum. Particularly, T(D) goes up even if T(D) is greater than 
T(W). This confirms the existence of a heat source inside the D/Pd system. (D/Pd::,;,0.3 in 
Fig.5) 
In order to check the accuracy of the thermometers, Fig.6 gives the vacuum calibration 
shortly before the hydrogen gas filling. T(W) and T(Pd) intercept just at the maximum point of 
T(Pd) with the accuracy of better than 0.02. We may also notice a spike in T(Pd) at 63000sec.

this is due to a little filling of hydrogen gas which causes an exothermal effect of hydrogen 
absorption.

wire. The height of this spike is about 0.05 Deg.C. 

Qualitatively, the abovementioned observation confirms the "excess heat" effect in the 
D/Pd system. However, quantitatively, the amount of "excess heat" is very small (<l W/c.c) 
because of the low loading ratio. But we observed also the burst of "excess heat" at higher 
temperature. Fig.7 shows a sudden jump of the temperature of palladium wire(T(D)) in the 
deuterium gas. In less than IO seconds, T(D) jumps from 1 72.1 to l 76.8°C. Since we have

measured the heat capacity of this system, it is known to be about 55 JfC. There must be a 
47° c 
heat source of the order of 55 JfCx-1 0·  
=25.9W. The volume of the palladium wire is
sec 
ICCF-7 
about 0.23c.c.; therefore, the power density of "excess heat" is higher than lO0W/c.c. at that 
moment. The resistance of the palladium wire had a jump at the same time ( from 3. 90 to 
4.10). This jump is partly due to the change of the temperature T(D). The temperature 
coefficient of palladium is about 4x10"3K1, which may cause a jump of 2% in resistance. The 
absorption of deuterium into palladium wire causes the jump in resistance also (3%). We 
recorded a pressure drop at the same time also (from 44800 Pa to 43400 Pa). This pressure 
drop in dewar just explains the remaining resistance jump. Roughly speaking, the loading ratio 
change of 0 .1 would cause a pressure drop of 5000Pa; hence, 1400 Pa drop in pressure just 
corresponds to a change in loading ratio of 0.03, which introduces a change in resistance by 
3%. Since the current in palladium wire was maintained as a constant (I.SSA), this jump in 
resistance would introduce a power jump of 0.48W which was much less than the power 
necessary for this temperature jump, i.e. 4.7 Deg.C in 10 seconds. All these analysis have 
shown that this temperature jump is a real physical phenomenon, not an accident error in 
detector. However, it is not easy to reproduce this high level "excess heat". 


4. Strategy.

In 2 years we have reproduced the "excess heat" three times in 2 different calorimetric
systems. It provides compelling evidences that there is excess heat in a D/Pd system. In order 
to make it compelling, we stopped the heating power inside the dewar, this results low level of 
loading; consequently, the low level of "excess heat". Roughly speaking, the "excess heat" is 
about 0.15 °Cx 3�v;/C =0.00SW or 20 mW/c.c .. Ifwe accept that 3.7 kW/c.c. for 11 minutes
in palladium rod is an "excess heat" of non-chemical origin ; then, 20 mW/c.c. should last 
2xl05 minutes to show its non-chemical origin. This means that we should run this experiment 
at least 4.5 months. 

On the other hand, we may try to identify any nuclear products to show its non-chemical 
origin as well. This idea was motivated by Miley's presentation in ICCF-6, and has bee 
reported else where[2].
