1. Introduction

As previously reported, the Lattice Energy Converter (LEC) has demonstrated the capability to convert thermal energy
in a codeposited palladium-hydrogen lattice into ionizing radiation [1]. It is well known that hydrogen will diffuse into
many metals and alloys to form an interstitial metal hydride [2] but it was not known if other metal hydrides would
produce results similar to the LEC palladium-hydrogen system.
H. Mehrer [3] discusses the diffusivity of hydrogen in various metals and includes a plot on page 322 of the
diffusivity of iron, palladium, and nickel as a function of inverse Kelvin temperature.
As shown, in Fig. 1, the hydrogen diffusivity of iron is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than that
of palladium at room temperature and is approximately equal to the hydrogen diffusivity of palladium at its melting
point.

Figure 1. Plot showing hydrogen diffusivity of Fe, Pd, and Ni vs. inverse temperature.

Diffusivity describes the ability of a H atom to circulate through the lattice under a relative H concentration gra-
dient. The reader may be surprised to see that diffusivity in Fe is larger than in Pd because it is well known that
palladium is quite permeable to hydrogen. This is because the permeability is given by the product of the diffusivity
by the hydrogen solubility in the metal. H solubility is much higher in Pd than in Fe and it is the reason why the
permeability is so high in Pd in spite of a lower diffusivity.

Although properties such as permeability and solubility may also contribute to LEC cell performance, diffusivity
may be an important parameter. The much lower cost and worldwide availability of iron could be important factors in
the future economic feasibility of LEC devices. For these reasons, LEC cells were prepared using working electrodes
of codeposited iron hydrogen-host-material (HHM) to evaluate iron-hydrogen performance.


2. Experimental description

As shown in Fig. 2, LEC cells were prepared where the codeposited Pd-H brass working electrode (WE) as previously
described [1], was replaced with a 1/8 inch by 4 inch black iron (low carbon steel) pipe nipple. The iron pipe nipple
included a protective coating to prevent oxidation which was removed by sanding. The iron pipe nipple was the
cathode in a plating solution of 0.1M FeCl2·4H2O in distilled H2O and platinum wires were the anode. The initial
plating current was approximately 100 µA/cm2 for 15 minutes and then increased to approximately 1 mA/cm2 for
15 minutes followed by an increase to approximately 2-3 mA/cm2, for approximately 4 hours, until the codeposited
Fe-H was visible and appeared to be uniform. The codeposited iron HHM WE was removed from the plating solution
and placed in a 1/2 inch galvanized pipe nipple counter electrode (CE)while avoiding physical contact between the
pipe nipples and connected to a digital voltmeter (DVM) to determine if a voltage was produced. If no voltage is
measured, additional codeposition of the HHM may be required. The codeposited iron WE is blotted dry and assembled
into a LEC cell. A vacuum (∼50 to 75 Torr) is pulled and the cell is reﬁlled with hydrogen gas. Hydrogen gas
pressures ranging from several hundred Torr to a few thousand Torr have been successfully tested and other pressures
are expected to work.

Multiple Fe-H LEC cells have demonstrated the ability to spontaneously produce a voltage and current. In addition,
there have been multiple successful replications of the Pd-H, and/or the Fe-H LEC by several individuals [4], [5],
[6], [7]. Similar results have been reported using modiﬁed cell designs including hydrogen or deuterium, modiﬁed
codeposition protocols, modiﬁed electrode geometries, as well as the inclusion of additional components between
the electrodes. [8], [9], [10]. The collective results provide compelling evidence of the existence of these surprising
phenomena.

3. Experimental Results

The Fe-H LEC cells have been characterized following the same procedures used for Pd-H LEC cells including tests
in air as well as in hydrogen [1]. A typical LEC cell test consists of several steps. The cell is placed in an electric kiln
at laboratory temperature that is instrumented with one or more thermocouples. The LEC electrodes are connected
to a high input impedance DVM (∼1000 MΩ) with the WE positive and the CE negative. A variable resistance box
is connected between the electrodes with a nominal starting resistance of 1 MΩ. The DVM is connected to a digital
computer via an optical USB connection and the recording sample rate is set at 2 S/s. The kiln is powered by a
variable voltage auto-transformer that is started at a low voltage setting and intermittently raised. LEC voltage and kiln
temperature are recorded, and variable resistance load tests are performed occasionally in order to characterize LEC
performance, i.e., LEC voltage versus load resistance at selected LEC operating temperatures.

Figure 3 is an example of Fe-H LEC performance in air at approximately 30 ◦C soon after it was removed from
the plating bath. The working electrode was a 1/8 inch by 4-inch black iron pipe nipple that was codeposited with iron
from a solution of 0.1 M FeCl2 in H2O.

A test to measure the LEC voltage under various load conditions was conducted immediately after the working
electrode was removed from the plating solution and placed in the counter electrode containing air at approximately
30 ◦C. The performance of this Fe-H LEC is qualitatively similar to that of a Pd-H LEC in that the load current of the
LEC behaves as if it were a current source shunted by a variable voltage conductance. More explanations can be found
in [1].

The shunt current as a function of load resistance is thus the difference between the load current at low load
resistance and the measured load current as a function of resistance. Load power is computed as load voltage squared
divided by load resistance or the product of load voltage by load current. Load power is found to be a maximum
at intermediate values of load resistance. Figure 4 shows LEC performance for a Pd-H WE comprised in part of a
stainless-steel screen electrode with codeposited Pd HHM and measured shortly after the electrode was removed from
the plating solution.

As experiments have demonstrated, a LEC cell develops a spontaneous voltage between the electrodes with no
input other than the energy in the lattice of the hydrogen-host-material including the thermal kinetic energy of the
hydrogen that is occluded therein. The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of a LEC cell is non-ohmic in the sense
that the current density and the electric ﬁeld do not go to zero simultaneously where cell current, I, is the integral of
the current density, i, over the surface area of the WE and the cell voltage, V , is the integral of the electric ﬁeld, E,
over the separation distance between the electrodes.

JSE Townsend observed [11].
“It is difﬁcult to calculate mathematically the equation of the current-electric-force curve in the general case
for parallel plate electrodes, when recombination and diffusion are in progress, as the problem becomes very
complicated owing to the fact that the number of ions per cubic centimetre varies at different points of the
gas.”

approximately 13 hours.

Eduard Riecke reported the full set of equations for the conduction of electricity through an ionized gas containing
two types of ions, positive and negative, in a parallel-plate condenser in 1903 [12]. An English translation of Riecke
is included as Appendix A. He considered the case where there was a space charge in the gas and included the effect
of the electric ﬁeld on the ions, the diffusion of the ions, as well as their recombination to form neutral molecules and
then was able to calculate the approximate distribution of the electric ﬁeld between the electrodes. Using this electric
ﬁeld distribution approximation, the spatial distribution of the ions between the electrodes now can be estimated by
integration assuming the densities of positive and negative ions are equal. Using modern notation, the equation giving
the current density in terms of ion drift and diffusion can be rewritten as:
i/e = (µ+ + µ−)En + (D− − D+)dn/dx
which has a solution of the form, [Appendix B]:
n(x) = (1/u(x))[
 
xu(x′)g(x′)dx′ + C], u(x) = exp[
 
xp(x′)dx′]
where p(x) = (µ+ + µ−)E(x)/(D− – D+), g(x) = (i/e)/(D− – D+), D± = µ±keV T, E(x) is the electric ﬁeld within
the gas, and C is a constant of integration that can be evaluated using boundary conditions.

As shown, the voltage increased initially when the temperature was less than 100 ◦C. As the temperature increased,
the voltage started to decay and ultimately changed polarity. During the initial phase of the test, load resistances were
changed from 3.3 k to 2.2 k to 1.0 kΩ which were selected to be approximately the loads that had produce the maximum
power in previous tests. Some of the abrupt changes in voltage during this time are due to the changes in load resistance.
After the voltage changed sign, the resistance was set to 1 MΩ except for times when load tests were conducted.

Figure 6 is a plot of a load test of an iron pipe nipple, codeposited with iron and placed in a galvanized CE that
was ﬁlled with hydrogen gas. The test was conducted as indicated on Fig. 5 when the temperature was approximately
160 oC. Even though the polarity of the voltage has switched, a plot of the absolute values of the variables has the
same features as shown in Figs. 3 and 4.

Figure 7 is a photograph of the working electrode that produced the data plotted in Figs. 5 and 6. The WE is a
1/8 inch black iron pipe nipple by 4 inches long that had codeposited with iron from an aqueous solution of 31% HCl
using iron wires as the anode. Prior to the test, the Fe codeposition was lumpy but after the test, multiple unusual
features are present. As shown these features appear to be the result of ejecta that produced a “cylindrical tower” that
is perpendicular to the surface of the WE and are clearly visible to the naked eye, unlike features reported from Pd-D
working electrodes that were a few microns in diameter [13]. The color of the inside surfaces of the ejecta is what
would be expected if the Fe had oxidized. This is the ﬁrst WE that we have observed with these features.


4. Possible explanation of LEC voltage generation and its behavior

As currently understood by the authors, LEC voltage generation and the conversion of lattice energy into electrical
energy is a multi-step process. Some of these steps are readily explained while others await full explanation. The ﬁrst
step, and perhaps least understood step, is the conversion of the thermal energy in the hydrogen occluded lattice of
electrodeposited HHM into some form of radiation. The second step is the conversion of the radiation into ionized
gas in ﬂuidic contact with the HHM and heat. The third step, and perhaps better understood step, is the conversion of
the ionized gas into voltage and current in an external resistive load impedance. Throughout this multistep process,
total energy, including mechanical, chemical, thermal, and nuclear, must be conserved. No ‘excess energy’ is being
produced.

One possibility is that the radiation generation process might be purely mechanical in origin. Thermally generated
phonons in the lattice of the HHM interact linearly or nonlinearly to produce regions of high amplitude atomic mo-
tion [14], [15] that interacts either directly with the occluded hydrogen atoms within the lattice; or indirectly with the
hydrogen atoms within lattice vacancies, super abundant vacancies, or other crystal defects to emit particulate and/or
electromagnetic radiation into the gas. Alternatively, the radiation generation might be due to some form of lattice en-
abled nuclear reaction (LENR) processes that produces particulate and/or electromagnetic radiation. Whatever process
or combination of processes responsible for the production of the radiation itself is difﬁcult to measure and determine
its form. That radiation is produced is indicated both by the fogging of ﬁlm [16], [17], the color change of chemically
treated paper exposed to the radiation [18], the production of voltage in semiconductor material exposed to the radia-
tion [19], the development of voltage in combinations of materials in contact with hydrogen and/or deuterium gas [9],
and by the conduction of electricity through H2, D2, and air exposed to the radiation [20], [21].

The conversion of radiation into ionized gas and heat is a well-documented process. The ionization of gas by
Röntgen rays (X-rays) was described by JJ Thomson and E Rutherford in 1896 [22] and by uranium rays in 1899 [23]
and it is now known that any energetic charged particle can ionize a gas [24] or water vapor [25]. The minimum energy
required to remove the ﬁrst electron from a gas is called the ionization potential and tables of ionization potential are
readily available [26]. The ionization potential for H2 is about 13.6 eV and that for D2 is about 15.5 eV. However, in
the process of ionizing a gas, translational and rotational energy also is imparted to the gas. In the case of polyatomic
molecules such as H2 and D2, energy also goes into internal bond motion so that the average energy required to ionize
gases is greater than their ionization potential. The average energy required to ionize a gas is known as the W-value
of the gas and is about 35 to 36 eV for H2 and D2 [27]. Thus, the thermal energy, enthalpy, or heat energy, of a gas
is increased by ionization and the total heat energy increase of the gas can be estimated by multiplying the W-value
of the gas by the ionization rate per unit volume of the gas and integrating over the volume of the gas being ionized.
The calculated thermal energy being produced based on the number of ions in the gas and the current produced, is
several orders of magnitude below that which calorimetry can detect. This opens the possibility that the occurrence
of LENR may be much more pervasive than calorimetry indicates, and when combined with the self-initiation and
self-sustaining capabilities demonstrated by the LEC, suggests a possible connection to the reactions and processes
leading to biological and nuclear transmutations. [28] [29].

The generation of the LEC voltage can occur in several ways. One possible way is that charged particles are
emitted from the WE with sufﬁcient energy to ionize the gas and while ionizing the gas transit through the gas to
the CE and deposit their charge on the counter electrode. This mode of voltage generation is analogous to that of
a direct charge nuclear battery [30] [31]. Another method of LEC voltage generation is by the photoelectric effect.
Electromagnetic energy emitted from the working electrode causes electrons to be emitted from the CE. The emitted
electrons then ionize the gas while behaving as free electrons before they attach to neutral molecules to become negative
ions. The emission of the electrons from the CE causes a charge to develop on the electrode and thus a voltage to be
generated. Another possibility of LEC voltage generation is that the WE and the CE have different work functions
thus generating a Volta effect voltage when the gas between the electrodes of different work functions is ionized. LEC
voltage generation also may be caused by the different rates of diffusion of positive and negative ion distributions in
the gas. These last two methods will be discussed in the following section.

In 1903 JJ Thomson published the ﬁrst edition of his treatise entitled Conduction of Electricity through Gases,
[32] that expanded on his 1899 paper “On the theory of the conduction of electricity through gases by charged ions,”
where he proposed a method to estimate the electric ﬁeld distribution in a conducting gas when diffusion of the ions is
neglected. In the same year, 1903, Eduard Riecke [12] at the University of Göttingen published in German his method
F. E. Gordon and H. J. Whitehouse / Journal of Condensed Matter Nuclear Science 36 (2022) 1–24
to estimate by successive approximation the electric ﬁeld distribution in a conducting gas when the diffusion of the
ions is included. An English translation is presented in Appendix A. Measurements of spontaneously conducting LEC
cells has shown that LEC cells behave as if they are a current source due to the diffusion of charge concentration within
the gas and an internal electric ﬁeld dependent shunt current caused by the drift of the ions due to the electric ﬁeld
within the gas. Thus, to explain the behavior of LEC cell voltage as a function of both time and temperature, it is
necessary to consider both the voltage across the cell and the distribution of charge within the cell.

In 1932 Karl K Darrow explained the spontaneous voltage developed when an ionized gas is contained between two
plane-parallel electrodes [33]. A summary of Darrow’s and other researchers’ contributions are given in [1]. Darrow’s
insightful contribution explaining the spontaneous voltage produced by a LEC where there are only two types of ions,
positive and negative, with different diffusion coefﬁcients is reproduced here with emphasis added.
“Suppose the ions of the two signs are spread identically through a gas between two walls—by ‘identically’
I mean that everywhere the concentrations of the two kinds are equal, though their common value varies
from place to place—and that this state of affairs is stationary. Then there must be ionizing rays acting
continually on the gas, and also there must be a potential-difference between the walls. For if there
were no ﬁeld, the negatives would diffuse along the concentration-gradient more rapidly than the positives;
there would be a net current; this would result in a depletion of negatives, and an excess of positive charge
would arise in the gas, in contradiction with the assumption. But suppose there is a P.D. [Potential Difference]
between the walls, in such a sense as to oppose the negatives and pull the positives forward as they stream
together down the gradient. A value for this potential-difference can be found, such that the ﬁeld strength will
retard the negatives and encourage the positives just sufﬁciently to annul the net current aforesaid;”

When a spontaneously conducting LEC is observed over an extended period of time, or when the temperature
is slowly changed, the voltage may vary with time or even change sign multiple times. When an externally applied
voltage on a LEC is reduced, the current may go to zero before the voltage goes to zero. This behavior is different than
that reported in early experiments on the conduction of electricity through gases that were carried out at the Cavendish
Laboratory in Cambridge [22], [23], [32] [34] and in later experiments using ionization chambers [35] where the I-V
characteristic was observed to be ohmic at low voltage. These unusual electrical phenomena need to be understood in
order that they can be either mitigated or exploited in future engineering applications of a LEC.

A cylindrical coaxial LEC with an externally applied voltage is similar to a Gerdien Condenser that is traditionally
used to measure the density of ions in a gas. Some Gerdien Condenser applications are to characterize atmospheric
pressure plasmas [36] or for atmospheric ion measurements [37]. A plane-parallel electrode LEC with external voltage
applied is similar to a plane-parallel ionization chamber [24] while a cylindrical LEC with externally applied voltage
is similar to a DC voltage ionization chamber with cylindrical electrodes [38]. Both a Gerdien Condenser and a LEC
behave strangely when no voltage is externally applied to the electrodes and although the explanations for the Gerdien
Condenser and LEC performance are different, similar phenomena may be responsible for both unusual behaviors.

4.1. Contact potential or work function effect:
Two possible causes of LEC voltage change with time and temperature are the variation of the work function of the
electrodes or variation in the mobility of the ions in the gas due to changes in the molecular or atomic composition
of the gas. With regard to the variation of the work function of the electrodes The Radio Corporation of America
(RCA) [39] reports that contact potential difference between electrodes of different material may lead to a measured
cell voltage when the gas between the electrodes is ionized. They report that
“The principle involved here goes back to 1897, when Lord Kelvin12 only a year after the discovery of
radioactivity by [Henri] Becquerel, used the radioactivity from uranium to ionize the air between two plates
F. E. Gordon and H. J. Whitehouse / Journal of Condensed Matter Nuclear Science 36 (2022) 1–24
of dissimilar metals and reported that he had observed a potential between them of up to 1.9 volts. · · ·
12 Kelvin, Lord, “Experiments on the Electrical Properties of Uranium”, Edinb. Roy. Soc. Proc. Vol. 21,
p. 417 (1897); also Mattr. and Phy. Papers, Vol. 6, p. 84 (1911). “The Direct Conversion of Radiation into
Electrical Energy””

In 1928 The Electrician [40] reports “A New Electronic Battery” by Mr. J. Kramer in his presidential address
before the Scientiﬁc Society of the Birmingham and Midlands Institute.
“This electronic cell would be similar to a voltaic couple, but the electrolyte would be replaced by radio-active
material. It might also be described as a “self-charging” condenser. · · · . Turning to the new development, it
is found that if the air gap between the dissimilar plates is occupied by radio-active materials a steady e.m.f.
is produced.”

In 1951 PE Ohmart [41] reports that
“Experiments have shown that if a cell, made up of two electrochemically dissimilar materials separated by
a gas, is connected to a current measuring device, a small continuous current will be caused to ﬂow from
the more noble to the more active electrode without an external source of voltage when the separating gas is
forcibly ionized by exposure to nuclear radiation. The current thus produced has been found to be dependant
upon the nature of the electrodes and their surfaces, the type and ﬂux of the energizing radiation, the type
and pressure of the ﬁlling gas, and (when excited by gamma radiation) the gamma stopping power of the
electrodes.”

With respect to the role that contact potential could have on the performance of a LEC, KL Alpin [37] reports that
for a Gerdien Condenser
“The tube material could be signiﬁcant for two reasons: ﬁrstly that of its durability when used in the ﬁeld, and
secondly that of the effect of contact potential. Wåhlin (1986) discusses the effect of the material of the tube,
opining that contact potentials cause offsets in the i-V response. This is credible, as two electrodes touching
a ﬂuid containing ions do make an electrochemical cell (e.g. Atkins, 1989), even if the electrolyte (air) is
dilute. According to Wåhlin (1986), a Gerdien will measure a non-zero current when the bias voltage is zero,
due to electrochemical potential at the surface of the tube. Wåhlin (1986) suggests that a steel tube has to be
biased at about 0.4 V and the aluminum at 1 V to counteract this. · · ·

Consider the variation of the work function or contact potential of the electrodes of a LEC. Although there are
listings of work function for many different materials, the work function of a given material is sensitive to the surface
properties of the material. During prolonged LEC operation the ionizing radiation as well as the gas ions that transit
to the electrodes can change the surface condition of the electrodes. Additionally, the fractional atomic loading of the
HHM with atomic (1H1) or molecular (1H2) hydrogen or a combination of these gases is a function of the density
of WE vacancies and other HHM structural defects such as grain boundaries. Fractional atomic loading of the HHM
depends on the over-potential of the ionized hydrogen gas as an electrolyte and the current load voltage of the LEC. The
number of HHM lattice vacancies varies exponentially with the inverse kelvin temperature of the HHM in accordance
with an Arrhenius equation of the form NV = N0exp(−Ea/keV T) where N0 is a constant depending on the lattice
material, Ea is an activation energy in electron volts (eV), keV is Boltzmann’s constant expressed in eV/K, and T is
the HHM temperature in Kelvin. Additionally, the number of grain boundaries increases with increased stress on the
HHM due to changes in lattice dimension due to the occlusion of the hydrogen in the HHM lattice structure.

4.2. Gas ion mobility effect:
There is a second phenomenon that in combination with changes in the work function or contact potential of the
electrodes of a LEC may explain the unusual voltage variation of a LEC. This is the variation of the composite mobility
of the gas ions due to changes in the composition of the gas during operation. A gas that is being ionized either by
interaction with energetic particles or by electromagnetic radiation, e.g., UV, X-rays, or gamma rays, may contain
several different types of molecules with different masses as well as free electrons that have not yet attached to neutral
molecules to form negative ions. Therefore, following Riecke [11], [12], assume that all ions carry a single charge, e,
the conduction equation for a LEC can be written for plane-parallel electrodes as
i/e =
 
k(vdk
+nk
+ − Dk
+dnk
+/dx) +
 
ℓ(vdℓ
−nℓ
− + Dℓ
−dnℓ
−/dx)
where i [A·cm−2] is the measured cell current density, vd± [cm·s−1] is the magnitude of the drift velocity vector,
vd± = µ±E(x), of the ions, µ± [cm2·V−1·s−1] is their mobility, E(x) [V·cm−1] is the electric ﬁeld strength, nk±(x)
[cm−3] their density, D± = µ±keV T their diffusion coefﬁcient, keV = 8.617x10−5 eV/K is Boltzmann’s constant, T
[K] the effective temperature of a gas ion or an electron, x [cm] the distance measured from the anode, k the number
of different positive ions, and ℓ the number of different negative ions. Note that the effective temperature of a free
electrons can be much greater than the temperature of the gas ions which are approximately the ambient temperature
of the gas.


5. Observations and Conclusions

1) The surprising phenomena produced by a LEC is real.
2) Carefully conducted control experiments using blank electrodes do not produce a voltage and current above
the extremely small currents and voltages predicted for conduction through air that has not been ionized except
for the naturally occurring ions [7].
3) LEC’s are easy to replicate and are not very sensitive to codeposition protocols.
4) Both the origin as well as the nature of the LEC radiation that ionizes the gas is unknown.
5) Possible mechanisms that might produce the initial ionizing radiation at the working electrode include:
(a) thermally induced vibration of the hydrogen host material’s lattice enhanced by nonlinear wave-wave
mixing in conjunction with the presence of hydrogen occluded in lattice vacancies near the surface of
the hydrogen host material;
(b) thermally induced interaction between multiple occluded hydrogen atoms contained within a vacancy,
or super abundant vacancy, or other crystal defects;
(c) LENR reactions such as when different nuclear spin orientations are present within a vacancy; or
(d) a combination of mechanisms.
6) Given that the gas between the electrodes is ionized, LEC properties such as spontaneous and self-sustained
production of a voltage and current has been explained.


6. Future research and development

Scaling up these experimental results to produce a commercial energy device requires 6-10 orders of magnitude.
Possible areas for improvement include:
(1) better metallurgy/materials and plating processes to increase the activity that produces the ionizing radiation;
(2) methods to increase ﬂux such as ﬂowing gas, increased temperature, gas pressure;
(3) cell designs to optimize electrode separation distance and electrode design; and
(4) the application of magnetic and/or electric ﬁelds.


7. Conclusions

The conduction of electricity in a LEC is signiﬁcantly different than that conventionally used to describe the conduction
of electricity through gases for several reasons [33], [44], [45]. First and foremost is the fact that the source of the
conduction is from some form of radiation produced by or within the hydrogen occluded hydrogen-host-material
(HHM) of the cell’s working electrode (WE). Secondly, the equivalent gas pressure caused by ‘over-potential’ in the
gas near the HHM of the working electrode [43] appears to cause the conduction to not ‘saturate’ as the voltage across
the cell increases.

Thirdly, diffusion of the ions plays a major role in the generation of the spontaneous voltage of a LEC when there
is no electrical input to the LEC. Finally, the electrical work function of the material of the counter electrode (CE) also
appears to play a role in the conduction of electricity in a LEC [41].

class. Issue 4. (1903).

8.1. On approximately saturated currents between plane-parallel plates:
In two earlier works1) I developed the theory of the currents which occur between two concentric spherical surfaces as
a result of the ionization of the air contained in the cavity. It was found that the observation of these currents provided
a means of determining the reunion [recombination] constant α. In considering this possibility, it seemed to me of
interest to also subject the case of an air space enclosed between two plane-parallel plates to a somewhat more precise
investigation.

8.1.1. The general equations of the problem:
Let one of two inﬁnite plates, which are parallel to each other at the distance l, be positively charged, the other
connected to the conductive [grounded to earth]. Let the intensity of the electric ﬁeld enclosed between the plates be
F. The air in the space between the plates is ionized, for example, by X-rays or radium rays. The ionization strength is
q, the density of the electric current generated by the force F [is] c. The densities of the positive and negative ions are
N+ and N−, their absolute mobilities U and V, their diffusion coefﬁcients k+ and k−. The coefﬁcient of reuniﬁcation
[or recombination] is α, the electrical elementary quantum is denoted by ε, the speed of light by v. We establish the
normal at some point on the positive plate. We make its base point the zero point, its two, which crosses over to the
negative plate, the positive direction of an axis x.

Then the following equations result:

We have four equations and we can consider the quantities F, q, N+, N− as unknowns; it is then assumed that the
current density c is determined by observation.

8.1.2. The saturation current:
If one neglects the inﬂuence of reuniﬁcation and diffusion, one obtains:1

vε(UN + + V N −)F = c,
q = vU d(N +F)

In order to get a more deﬁnite idea of the values of the coefﬁcients appearing in these uations, it seems useful to
put them as much as possible in numerical form.

It follows from this that the variability of the ﬁeld strength will in general only be very small.

The theory of the saturation current is only applicable if

are very small with respect to q.

From the condition that q should be large compared to k−d2N −/dx2 it also follows:

8.2. Unsaturated current, ﬁrst approximation:

If in these formulas, instead of q2, N +
1 and N −
1 , one substitutes the values that follow from the previous one,
the result is complicated expressions. We shall only elaborate a little further on the ﬁrst of the equations, since it is
linked to the possibility of determining the value of the constant α of the reuniﬁcation from observations of unsaturated
currents.
To do this, we bring the equation to the form:
εlq2 − c = αε
  l
N +
1 N −

Let’s use the abbreviation:

  l

so [this] becomes:

If you use these values to calculate the integral

The numerical calculation gives:

F2
 

You can roughly write:
εlq2 − c = αε × 0, 85 × 10−6 q2l3
F2
+ α2ε × 0, 143 × 10−12 q3l5
F4
Here is:
c = εlq.

The equation therefore comes in the simpler form:
l (q2 − q) = α × 0, 85 × 10−6 × q2l3
F2
+ α2 × 0, 143 × 10−12 × q3l5
F4
If one uses this equation to calculate α, the result is:
α = 1, 18 × 106 × F2
0 (q2 − q)
l2q2
 
1 − 0, 20q2 − q
q
 
So the value of α becomes smaller if the quadratic term is also taken into account.

If one introduces instead of q2 and q the dimensions C of the saturation current and c of the actually observed
current, then:
α = 5, 52 × 10−4 × (C − c)F2

1 − 0, 20C − c

9. Appendix B: LEC Current Behavior and Ion Distribution

9.1. Introduction:
Much helpful information to understand the behavior of LEC cells can be learned from the work on the conduction of
electricity through gases by the late Sir JJ Thomson and other researchers at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge
University near the turn of the 19th century [22], [23], [34]. However, the various different conﬁgurations and uses
of LEC cells result in fundamental differences in performance than those reported by early authors. One of their
primary interests was to understand the processes that take place when gas is ionized. Thomson makes the following
assumptions [34] using the CGS-ESU system of units (emphasis added):
“Let n1, n2 be respectively the number of positive and negative ions per unit volume at a place ﬁxed by the
coordinate x, let q be the number of positive or negative ions produced in unit time per unit volume at this point by the
ionizing agent; let X be the electric intensity at this point, k1, k2 the velocities of the positive and negative ions under
unit electric intensity, so that the velocities of those ions at this point are respectively k1X, k2X; let e be the charge
on an ion. The volume density of the electriﬁcation, supposed due entirely to the presence of the ions, is (n1 − n2) e;
hence we have
dX/dx = 4π (n1 − n2) e

If i is the current through unit area of the gas, and if we neglect any motion of the ions except that caused by the
electric ﬁeld, we have
n1ek1X + n2ek2X = i
Thomson continues by combining equations (1) and (2) and solving for n1e and n2e. Then he observes that in a steady
ionization state, ion losses by recombination must be balanced by ionization (emphasis added):
“We shall suppose that the number of positive or negative ions which recombine in unit volume in unit time is
αn1n2 : this is the rate at which unit volume is losing positive and negative ions in consequence of recombination;
in consequence of ionization it is gaining them at the rate q, and in consequence of the motion of the ions under the
electric force it is losing positive ions at the rate d (n1k1X) /dx and negative ones at the rate −d (n2k2X) /dx. The
diffusion of the ions causes unit volume to lose positive and negative ions at the rates D1 d2n1/dx2, −D2 d2n2/dx2,
where D1 and D2 are the coefﬁcients of diffusion of the positive and negative ions. Unless the electric ﬁeld is very
weak the motion of the ions by diffusion is, except in quite exceptional cases, insigniﬁcant in comparison with
that under the electric ﬁeld.”

The authors believe that it is the diffusion of the ions that is the primary source of the spontaneous ‘open circuit’
voltage of a LEC as well as the spontaneous ‘short circuit’ current measured at low values of load resistance and thus
‘very weak’ electric ﬁelds. Although diffusion is most evident for the spontaneous conduction mode of LEC operation
it nevertheless still plays a role in determining the I-V characteristics of LECs with multiple counter electrodes (CE)
as well as two-electrode LECs operated in the impressed voltage or current mode.

9.2. Current Saturation during Impressed Conduction:
An important characteristic of the conduction of electricity through gases is the rate of gas ionization q. This is
traditionally accomplished by measuring the current density, i, at voltages sufﬁciently high that the magnitude of
the drift velocities, vd, of the ions, i.e., k1X, k2X in CGS ESU or µ1E, µ2E in CGSA units, are sufﬁciently high
that the ions drift to the electrodes in a time short enough so that there is a minimum loss of ion charge by ion-ion
recombination. JJ Thomson and E Rutherford [22] report that:
“for a given intensity of radiation the current through the gas does not exceed a certain maximum value whatever
the electromotive force may be, the current gets, as it were, ‘saturated.”’

Figure B.1. Current saturation curve adapted from JJ Thomson [34].

Figure B.2. Impressed current-voltage (I-V) curve for a Pd − D cell with 6 mm electrode separation.

An example current voltage (I-V) saturation curve similar to that in [22] is shown in Fig. B.1. This curve clearly
shows an ‘ohmic’ behavior at low voltage, i.e., current goes to zero linearly as the electromotive force (EMF) goes to
zero.

However, when a two-electrode LEC cell, i.e., one working electrode (WE) and one counter electrode (CE), is
operated in the impressed current/voltage mode the measured I-V curve is remarkably different. Figure B.2 shows the
measured (I-V) curve for a Pd-D LEC cell reported in [1],

Note, that the current instead of saturating as the voltage is increased, the current increases rapidly and shows no
indication of saturation at a voltage across the cell of approximately 250 V for a cell with an electrode separation of
approximately 6 mm. Analysis of the conduction data for this cell showed that the measured current increased as a
cubic polynomial in cell voltage. This difference in performance is thought to be caused by the signiﬁcant differences
in the way that the gas is being ionized. When the cube root polynomial of the cell current is plotted versus the cell
voltage the result is an approximately straight line that upon extrapolation to zero voltage does not pass through the
origin of the graph. This is due to the presence of ion diffusion in addition to ion drift and ion-ion recombination. In
fact, it was this observation that lead to the discovery of spontaneous LEC conduction that was reported in [1].

Only when the full set of equations that include the diffusion term are examined, such as those published by
Eduard Riecke in 1903, is it seen that a LEC can have ‘non-ohmic’ behavior at low voltage. It is the diffusion term
that introduces the ‘non-ohmic’ behavior, i.e., current does not necessarily go to zero when the electric ﬁeld goes to
zero. An English translation of Riecke’s University of Göttingen is presented in Appendix A. This German language
paper includes the complete set of 1-dimensional equations, including diffusion, for a gas composed of both positive
and negative ions.

A potential explanation of the difference in the behavior of the ionized-gas conduction experiments by early re-
searchers at the Cavendish Laboratory and experiments performed by the authors is in the structure and preparation
of the working electrode (WE) of the LEC. In all Inovl experiments the WE is comprised in part of hydrogen-host-material (HHM), i.e., black Pd or black Fe, occluded with atomic hydrogen during electrochemical HHM codeposition
performed in light water (H2O). In addition to occluding hydrogen in the HHM during electrodeposition, Fukai [2]
also has shown that a large number of super-abundant vacancies (SAV) are introduced in the electrodeposited metal. In
most 2-electrode impressed conduction experiments the gas in ﬂuidic contact with both the WE and the counter elec-
trode (CE) is hydrogen
 1H2
 
although for the experiment described in Fig. B.2. the gas was deuterium
 2H2
 
. Since
ionized gas acts as electrolyte during conduction there is a potential difference developed in the gas which increases
as the voltage across the cell increases. This causes an increase in the excess or ‘over-potential’ near the surface of the
WE as a function of the voltage across the cell. Fukai [43] has shown that a small increase of ‘over-potential’ causes
a large equivalent gas pressure, e.g., several thousand atm, due to fugacity at the cathode during aqueous electrodepo-
sition or electrolysis. Figure B.3 is a plot of equivalent gas pressure versus excess or over-potential from Fukai [43].
Thus, the presence of numerous SAV that can receive atomic hydrogen and the large equivalent hydrogen gas pressure
to ﬁll the SAV may account to the remarkably different I-V characteristics, e.g., convex for Inovl versus concave for
Cavendish, as well as the lack of saturation for the Inovl impressed conduction experiments.

Figure B.3. Equivalent gas pressure versus excess voltage during electrolysis.

9.3. Current Saturation during Spontaneous Conduction:
When a 2-electrode LEC is operating in the spontaneous voltage mode then diffusion and ion-ion recombination are
the dominant conduction controlling factors rather than excess or ‘overpotential’ since the voltage across the cell and
thus the electric ﬁeld strength within the gas are low relative to their values during impressed current/voltage LEC
operation. Figures B.4 and B.5 show the I-V (Note: V is not shown) curve for a freshly prepared Fe-H LEC operating
in air at NTP. In addition to the I-V curve calculated shunt current and power in the load resistance also are shown.

9.4. Ion Distribution Equations:
Consider ﬁrst analyzing the performance of a LEC under the condition of an impressed voltage. To simplify the
analysis, assume that the electrical properties of the electrodes are the same, i.e., their work functions are the same,
Also assume that the current density through the gas, i, is the same everywhere over the surface of the electrodes, that
the density of ions, n+and n−, only depends on the electrode separation variable, x or r, that the positive and negative
ion mobilities are effective measured values, i.e., the weighted harmonic means of the different ion-type mobilities,
and that the electric ﬁeld can be estimated everywhere throughout the gas. Additionally, following the practice of early
authors, let the equations be written in CGS-ESU, i.e., current density is in statAmps, voltage is in statVolts, the unit
charge, e, is approximately 4.8032 × 10−10 statCoulombs or esu, and the ions carry only one charge per ion.

Figure B.4. Fe-H 1 1 4 “black Fe WE and 3/4” Cu CE using Air at NTP.

Figure B.5. Cell voltage (mV) versus load resistance in kΩ for Fe-H cell using air.

Making these assumptions, the general equations describing the conduction can be written, following Riecke but
using modern notation, as:
dE/dx = 4πe
 
n+ − n− 
(B1a)
e
 
µ+n+ + µ−n− 
E − ed
 
D+n+ − D−n− 
/dx = i,
(B1b)
q = µ+d
 
n+E
 
/dx − D+d2n+/dx2 + αn+n−,
(B1c)
q = −µ−d
 
n−E
 
/dx − D−d2n−/dx2 + αn+n−.
(B1d)
Using CGSA, MKSA or the SI system of units published in 1960 and used in [36], [37], and [38] equation (B1a)
becomes equation (B1a′)
dE/dx = e(n+ − n−)/ε
(B1a′)
where ε is the permittivity of the gas and the value of the elementary charge is e := 1.602176634 × 10−19C since

for no space-charge (NSC) and space charge (WSC) [46].

Further, it should be noted that the measured variables of a LEC are the total current, I, and the voltage, V, between
the electrodes. These quantities are related to the corresponding variables, i, and E as integrals, i.e., I =
 
S i dS and V
 
E(x) dx where dS is an element of electrode surface area and x is the variable representing the separation distance
between the electrodes, e.g., for coaxial cylindrical electrodes of radius ra ≤ r ≤ rb then V =
 
rarb E(r) dr. Also, it is
important to observe that even if the electric ﬁeld were identically zero everywhere within the gas, E(x) = 0, the current
density i would not be zero unless d(D+n+ – D−n−)/dx vanishes also. This means that the conductivity of the gas is
not necessarily ohmic in the sense that I ̸= GV were G is the conductance of the gas.

Darrow assumes that there is only one type of positive ion and one type of negative ion at that these ions are present
in equal numbers [33]. Then equation (B1b) can be rewritten as
i/e = (µ+ + µ−) En + (D− − D+) dn/dx
(B2)
which has a solution of the form [42]:
n(x) = (1/u(x))
   x
u (x′) g (x′) dx′ + C
 
, u(x) = exp
   x
p (x′) dx′
 
(B3)
where p(x) = (µ+ + µ−) E(x)/ (D− − D+) , g(x) = (i/e)/ (D− − D+) , D± = µ±keVT, E(x) is the electric ﬁeld
within the gas, and C is a constant of integration.

The equations for the distribution of charge, neglecting diffusion but including recombination,have been developed
by Townsend in 1915 for the case of plane-parallel electrode geometry on page 72 [11]. However,the equations
are not evaluated to produce a graph of the ion charge-density as a function of position between the electrodes. R
Rosen and EP George in 1975, also neglecting diffusion but including recombination, have evaluated the equations for
the distribution of charge for both the cases of plane-parallel and cylindrical electrode geometry.Theirevaluation for
cylindrical geometry is reproduced as Fig. B.6 for the case of electrode radii a = 0.059 cm and b = 1.59 cm and air at
1 atm.

10. Conclusions

For several reasons the conduction of electricity in a LEC is signiﬁcantly different than that conventionally used to
describe the conduction of electricity through gases [33], [44], [45]. First and foremost is the fact that the source of
the conduction is from some form of radiation produced by or within the hydrogen occluded hydrogen-host-material
(HHM) of the cell’sworking electrode (WE). Second, the equivalent gas pressure caused by ‘over-potential’ in thegas
near the HHM of theworking electrode [43] appears to cause the conduction to not ‘saturate’ as the voltage across
the cell increases. Third, diffusion of the ions plays a major role in the generation of the spontaneous voltage of a
LEC when there is no electrical input to the LEC. Finally, the electrical work function of the material of the counter
electrode (CE) also appears to play a role in the conduction of electricity in a LEC [41].
