For the purpose of searching for heavy nuclei generated in the result of low energy nuclear
processes we used samples of 28Ni58 which were bombarded with 27 MeV electrons from the Resonance
accelerator MI-30. The samples of nickel of 48 mm in diameter and 20 mm thick were irradiated with
electrons to the level of absorbed energy of around 2.5 106 J/cm3 which is approximately 5 times exceeds the
minimum specific energy at which as it followed from the authors’ theoretical model the process of
generating transmuted elements will become quite noticeable.

The experimental work consisted in measuring gamma-spectra accompanying decay of radioactive
nuclei generated inside Nickel samples in the result of photo nuclear reactions and other nuclear interactions.

The Nickel samples of 48 mm in diameter and 10 mm thick were irradiated with 27 MeV electrons.
After 9 months delay which resulted in decreasing the induced radioactivity the samples were measured with
a Ge-Li detector of coaxial type that had resolution of 2.2 keV at 1.33MeV using a multichannel MatchMaker
analyzer. The total count rate of the spectrometer was kept at the level at which the relative “dead time” did
not exceed 3-5%. In order to limit the background the detector and the samples were placed inside a lead
shield container with the thickness of the walls equal to 3 cm. with a purpose of increasing the relative
amount of high energy gamma-quanta in the spectra to be measured and decreasing the intensity of “soft”
gamma-quanta(Co57-122keV; 136keV0 thin filters of Pb(0.6 mm) and Cd(1.0 mm) were placed between the
Ni-samples and the detector.

All the spectra lines of gamma-quanta originating from the nuclides within the range from 39Y88 to
77Ir192 were carefully analyzed with a special attention toward those of them which obtain the T1/2 periods
from 100 up to 300 days. The information related to a number of those nuclides did not allow to come to a
reliable conclusion about the presence or absence of the synthesized nuclei. It can be stated more surely about
availability of such isotopes as 45Rh102, 76Ta182, 76Os185, 77Ir192. The most exactly the presence of 45Rh102 can
be stated. Disintegration of this isotope is accompanied with irradiation of gamma-quanta with energies of
475.1 keV and 556.41 keV. These energies in the spectrum were identified with maximum errors of 0.18 keV
for the energy of 475.1 keV and 0.17 keV for the energy of 556.41 keV.

While determining the specific intensities of gamma-quanta with such energies special careful
attention was given to evaluation of the absence of energy coincidences in those energy regions. It was
determined that those energy lines resulted from the coincidences have the energy resolution which is 1.5
times worse than the resolution for the real energy lines of gamma-quanta at the same energies. At the same
time the amplitudes of those lines are several decades of magnitude lower than the amplitudes of real energy
lines.

Based upon the careful analysis of the likely errors in identification of gamma-radiation of the
synthesized nuclides it was determined that the error of their identification depends only from the statistical
errors and the errors in calibration of the energy scale of the spectrometer.

So, in the result of the careful analysis it was reliably determined that the synthesis of 45Rh102 from
the nuclei and fragments of nuclei of 28Ni58 is a real experimental fact.
