1. Introduction

In computer simulations using molecular dynamics methods, it was previously shown that the electrons of the outer
shells of metals have a shielding effect on deuterons and significantly accelerate nuclear fusion reactions. The results of
quantitative calculations of the reaction rates of hydrogen isotopes in a number of metals are published in Refs. [1]–[6].
In this paper, we model the behavior of hydrogen atoms in the flow of free electrons in metals.

1.1. Description of the Model:
At the first stage, within the frame of classical (non-quantum) mechanics, the behavior of a single deuterium atom is
simulated when acted upon by a flow of free electrons7
. It is assumed that the particles do not radiate electromagnetic
waves. The system consists of a deuteron and two electrons. At the initial moment, one of the electrons (orbital) is in
the circular orbit of Bohr radius 0.529 ˚A. The flow of incoming electrons is isotropic; the impact parameter is limited
by the value 0.53 ˚A.

The incoming electrons appear at the 1 ˚A distance from the deuteron; the kinetic energy of the incoming electrons
follows the Fermi distribution with the parameters characteristic of free electrons in a Pd crystal at room temperature8
:

f(ε) = const√
ε/{1 + exp[(ε − ε
∗
)/kT]},

where ε
∗ = h
2
(3ne/π)
3/2/8me is the so-called characteristic energy, nedesignates the free electrons concentration,
h is Planck’s constant, k is the Boltzmann constant; and the absolute temperature T is assumed to be equal to 350 K.
According to Ref. [3], we assume that for every atom there is a single free electron. Then ne ≈ NA · ρ/A. For
palladium, ne ≈ 6.8 × 1022cm−3
, ε
∗/k ≈ 7 × 104 K. The average kinetic energy of free electrons in palladium is
3ε
∗/5 ≈ 3.6eV, the average electron velocity v ≈ 1.13 × 108
cm/s.

After random initial conditions have been specified, particle trajectories are calculated by numerically solving a
system of differential equations of mechanics. Relativistic equations are used but without allowance for magnetic
effects, i.e. the particle interaction is considered purely Coulomb interaction. The system of equations is solved by
Runge-Kutta method of the fourth order with the relative error less than 10−5
.

As has already been mentioned, at any instant three particles can be tracked, i.e., two electrons and one deuteron.
When one of the electrons travels at a distance exceeding 10 ˚A, the remaining system (unsteady state of deuterium
D
∗
atom) is bombarded by a new free electron, etc. Nmax = 104 model experiments have been conducted. Number l
of free electrons collisions with the D∗
“atom” could reach up to lmax = 100.

When one of the electrons approached the deuteron at a distance less than 10−13 cm, trajectories were no longer
calculated. This implementation of incoming electron parameters was excluded from consideration and a transition to
a new implementation of a system took place with an initial Bohr orbit of the deuterium atom. Therefore, the number
of simulated D∗
“atoms”, which underwent l collisions with electrons, N(l) < Nmax. For instance, N(10) = 9101,
N(50) = 3331, N(80) = 1489, N(100) = 847. The total number N* of simulated D∗
“atoms”

N∗ =

N(l) = 420748 < Nmax × lmax = 106
.

A high proportion of electrons collisions with D∗
results in the decreased energy of D∗
and its size. For the D∗
size
the distance r from the electron to the deuteron is taken at the apogee of the orbit. The size distribution density of D∗
,
which underwent l collisions with electrons, will be designated as f(r|l).

We had to exclude from our consideration trajectories in the region of small distances in order to prevent the
degradation of the trajectories calculation accuracy and to enhance the program response. Special calculations showed
that for a significant proportion of neglected trajectories there was a pronounced trend for the electron impingement on
the deuteron, which could have resulted in the formation of a bineutron. The program, however, was not yet sufficient
to calculate this process accurately enough. Part of the neglected trajectories could have also lead to the formation
of D∗ of even smaller sizes. Those two possibilities potentially can significantly increase the theoretically estimated
value of the fusion reaction rate and require supplementary research. For the time being, we assume that under more
accurate trajectories calculation all the excluded implementations result in the formation of D∗ whose size obey the
same distributions f(r|l). In this connection, distributions are normalized similarly for any l:

Z ∞
0
f(r|l)dr = 1.

The number l of the D∗
“atom” collisions with free electrons obeys Poisson distribution Pa(l) with the parameter
a; the average number of collisions a is proportional to the electron flow density and time.

The main contribution to the reaction rate make small D∗
(r∼10−11 cm), that have a high mobility. So, the crystal
lattice does not strongly interfere with D*-D* collisions. Let n and N be the concentration and full quantity of D∗
atoms
in the working volume of crystal. The proportion of deuterons λ, which reacted in a unite time (fractional reaction rate
λ) is equal to:

It will be assumed that D∗
“atoms” with the shell sizes r1, r2 move freely if the “shells” do not overlap, i.e., if
the distance between the D∗
“atoms” is r > r1 + r2. If the “shells” overlap, a purely Coulomb repulsion of the D∗
“atoms” is observed. The potential deuterons interaction energy in this approximation is equal to

V (r) = 

.

Since at any energy E contributing to λ there holds a condition E << Es, the approximation P(E) ≈
P(0), FM(E) = δ(E − E) can be used where E = 3kT /2. Then 

λ(l, m) = C Z ∞ 0 dr1 Z ∞ 0 dr2f(r1|l)f(r2|m)W(r1 + r2), 

where C = (nS0/2)(2/µE) 1/2 , W(r1 + r2) = exp  −1.39p (r1 + r2)/re  .

Taking into account the probabilistic sense of f(r|l), the reaction rates λ(l, m), λ(a) could be approximately calculated by the formulas 

λ(l, m) = C N(l)N(m) N X (l) i=1 N X (m) j=1 W(r (l) i + r (m) j ), λ(a) = C X N ∗ i=1 X N ∗ j=1 Pa(l(i))Pa(m(j)) N(l(i))N(m(j)) W(ri + rj ),

where ri

2. Calculation Results

Recall that f(r|l) is the size distribution of the atom that has experienced l collisions with electrons. The simulation
showed that the distributions of f(r|l), starting from about l = 50, are almost the same with a further increase in l (see
Figure 1). The equilibrium distribution can be close to that found if the characteristic time of the quantum relaxation
of the “miniatom” exceeds 10−13 s.

Table 1 presents the number of events with the size r and the number of collisions l from the different ranges; ∆N∗
is the total number of events with l from these ranges.

Table 2 shows the dimensions of the 10 smallest “miniatoms” of deuterium D∗
, which have r ≤ 2×10−11cm. The
“orbits” are usually very elongated: rmin << r, so using the value r as the size of the “atom” should lead to a lower
estimate of λ.

Figure 2 shows the functions λ(l, l) and λ(a). Averaging λ(a) over a ≤ lmax, which is equivalent to averaging over
time, leads to the result λ ≈ 2 × 10−4
s
−1
, which is 106
times greater than the value obtained in Refs. [2] and [4]

on the basis of the dynamic model of electron orbital deformation (EODD). Taking into account that λ(a) somewhat
increases with the increase in a, the obtained average λ should be treated as a lower-bound estimate. The contribution
of 370 events presented in Table 2 to the obtained value of λ is 99%, including the contribution of 10 events from
Table 1 amounting to about 80%.


3. Discussion

The application of classical mechanics usually provokes objections because classical mechanics enables one to put a
shielding charge at any point and impart it any initial velocity (e.g., zero velocity). We deem it therefore important to
emphasize that the equiprobable initial conditions we employed correspond to the real-life situation. In addition, the
applied approach, which could be called the Bohr approach, is not a purely classical one, since the radiation has been
“turned off”. Quantum-mechanical models allowing for elastic processes only give a sufficiently accurate description
of real physical processes for a very wide range of phenomena.

It should be noted that from the quantum-mechanical viewpoint, D∗
is not a kind of a hypothetical atomic state
with energies lower than that of the ground state. D∗
should be treated as an unsteady structure within many-particle
nonradiating system.

We indicate a possible mechanism for the occurrence of such configurations under the action of a flow of free
electrons, having previously made an estimate of the collision frequency of the “atom” D* with electrons. It was said
above that the maximum value of the impact parameter of the incoming electrons in our calculations was equal to
rB, and any outcome was counted as a collision. The average number of such collisions of an “atom” with electrons

is the density of the flow of free electrons
in a palladium crystal. The average time between two successive collisions of an “atom” with free electrons is equal
to ∆τ = 1/Φπ r2
B ≈ 1.5 · 10−15s. In some cases, as a result of the interaction of electrons, one of them (flying or
orbiting, let’s call it “electron 1”) can fly a sufficiently large distance (several Å) from the deuteron; for a while (∆t)
it seems to be out of the game, since it is far away and does not determine the size of the “atom”. But it takes away
some of the energy, which leads to the fact that the remaining electron (“electron 2”) will make revolutions around the
center along an open trajectory, which we will call a “non-stationary orbit”; its average dimensions are smaller than
the original dimensions of the atom and during ∆t these determine the actual dimensions of the “atom”. The returned
electron 1 returns part of the energy to electron 2, which as a result flies away to infinity. If the final energy of the
atom is not less than the initial energy, then such a classical movement of electrons does not contradict the fact of the
existence of a lower energy stationary state of the atom. Since electron 1 can fly far enough away, a non-stationary
orbit may well exist for a time of order ∆t = 10−15s; then it is very likely that it will be exposed to the next free
electron, and this may lead to the formation of a non-stationary orbit of an even smaller size, etc.


4. Conclusions

Dynamic modeling without taking into account quantum effects predicts the formation of non-stationary particles
consisting of protons (deuterons) with an electron rotating around them in orbits close to elliptical, with an apogee of
∼10−11 cm and a perigee of ∼ 10−12 cm. These “mini-hydrogen atoms”, which vary in size and shape, are up to 3-4
orders of magnitude smaller than ordinary hydrogen atoms, but 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than neutrons. They
can exist and move in the environment of free electrons of metals, and, like neutrons, approach the nuclei of isotopes
of hydrogen or other elements at a distance at which, due to the tunneling effect, nuclear reactions of synthesis or
transmutation of elements are possible. The formation of such atoms increases the previously calculated rate of nuclear
reactions in metals1-6 by 5-6 orders of magnitude, that is, to values corresponding to experimental data.
