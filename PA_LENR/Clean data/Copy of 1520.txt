Dissipation calorimeter (Stefan-Boltzmann Law)
•
Borosilicate glass, with wire wrapped around mica insulation
•
~57 W input power1


Celani Reactor/Calorimeter, ICCF-17, August 2012


Important Parameters
•
Excess heat

Summary of Verification Results 


Lessons Learned/Best Practices 
• LENR not as robust as indicated in demonstrations 
• Experiments begin with replication, then proceed to reproducing effect 
• Dissipation-type calorimeter needs verification (e.g., mass flow) 
• Reactor calibration required with each experimental setup 
• Resistance reduction may be influenced by factors besides H loading 
• Metallurgy of treated Constantan more complicated than thought 
• Proper temperature profile essential for accurate calorimetry 
• Lack of verification in this survey does not negate possibility of LENR
