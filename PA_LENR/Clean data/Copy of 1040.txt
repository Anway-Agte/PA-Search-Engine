1. Introduction

In presence of a force F the Hydrogen flux in the lattice (as a continuum) is well described by the
law:

J = -nDgradc + ncMF (1)

where c is the H atomic concentration, D is the diffusion coefficient , M is the H mobility and n
is the number of lattice atoms per unit volume.

Stress gradients within a sample cause an additional force on the Hydrogen interstitials:
(2)

where P is the trace of the dipole-moment tensor and Sijkl and O'kl are tensor components of the
elastic coefficient and of the stresses respectively.

The stress induced by Hydrogen diffusive flux will cause an inhomogeneous distribution of the
solute. The eq. (1) will be in this case: 

V l=-D(Vc--Va)
RT (3)

where V is the molar volume of Hydrogen into the metal. Kandasamy [1] showed that a suitable
strain can stop the diffusion of Hydrogen driven by the concentration gradient.
If internal stresses can be removed either by plastic deformation or by dislocation slipping, such
stress-free strained crystal can be defined "incoherent". In the opposite case a deformation field
will be associated to the strain and the crystal can be defined "coherent". The "real" crystal will
be a mixture of the two cases depending on the initial metallurgical state.

From (3) it follows that the diffusive flux can be blocked if

RT Va=-Vc
cV
(4)

assuming V c = c - 0, a = 140 MP a (V = 1.68 cm3 /mol, c= 0. 7) that is a typical value of yield
strees for Palladium [2]. This means that the stress produced by loading Hydrogen (and its
isotopes) in Palladium can induce plastic deformations into the lattice.
Thus the loading dynamic it is very important in order to avoid the dislocation growth related to a
strong concentration gradient. 


2. Dynamic influence on loading process

Starting a diffusive process can produce very high strain field just under the surface thus making 
the further Hydrogen uptake very difficult. 

We can overcome the problem essentially in two ways. Firstly avoiding the growth of strong 
concentration gradient either with a very slow loading or with a suitable loading procedure. The 
second approach is to relieve the stresses generated in the metal through dislocation slipping. 

The adsorption isotherms for Hydrogen in Palladium show that, at room temperature and for a 
concentration above c=0.008 H/Pd atoms, an a phase with low Hydrogen content and an expanded, 
Hydrogen-rich, /3 phase coexist in the solid solution up to a concentration of c=0.607. It is well 
known that during the loading expanded /3 areas grow near the a areas, so that, during the 
coexistence phase, very strong deformation fields are generated at the border of the two phases, 
due to the different lattice parameters. 

Coexistence of a+ {3 phases can be avoided during the loading process by selecting an appropriate 
path on the p-c(D)-T diagram (see fig. I). Increasing the isothermal temperature over the critical 
point (T=310°C, p=34 atm) it is possible to reduce the percentage of non-relaxed stresses by 
skipping the coexistance phase. 

Figure I - Hydrogen-Palladium phase diagram. The gas loading experimental 
path is the line ABC. A thermodinamic quasi-reversible process must be 
obtained with a slow loading. At the end of the loading sequence the loading 
ratio is evaluated by weighting the sample. 


3. Experimental details

Palladium 14 by 10 mm sheets 150 µm thick were submitted to cathodic discharge in Li OH
solution. The Hydrogen concentration was monitored, measuring the variation of electrical
resistance with a lock-in amplifier based system. The ratio R(c)/R(c=0), defined in the following
as R!Ro, is related to the concentration c so that it is possible to follow the concentration in real
time during the electrolysis. Samples were temperature treated in vacuum for 0.5 hour at 900 °C.

We compare the maximum loading reached with two different procedures: 

•
a) sheet was charged in electrolysis ;

•
b) sheet was pre-charged in H2 gas.

The loading procedure for the pre-charged samples is the following:
the Palladium sheets were heated to 400 °C under vacuum and then Hydrogen pressure of 40 atm
was set up. A very slow cooling to room temperature keeping the pressure constant was performed
and, after a suitable time, the vessel was evacuated. This path allows to skip the coexistence phase
avoiding the growth of high stress field at the border of a-� phases (see fig. 2): the curve (a)
refers to sample loaded only in electrolysis without any particular care, the current density being
1=2.5 mA/cm2 ; the curve (b) refers to a sample pre-loaded in gas and then electrolyzed as the
previous one.

It is very clear the effect of the different loading procedure.

A further concentration increase is obtained allowing both the stress relieve through the anodic
stripping ( a short anodization of Pd) of the surface and the reduction of the concentration gradient
changing the current density periodically (see fig.3).

sign change) accelerated the loading process. A further current
increase stabilized the concentration. In this experiment the maximum
value of concentration is close to 1.


4. The influence of the microstructure

The metallurgical character of Pd could strongly affect the final loading ratio. 
Assuming that the main problem is to avoid high stress field inside the lattice we must choose the 
best metallurgical structure for such a goal. 

• the grain influence both the diffusion times and the elastic energy storage

• the defects density affects the possibility to relieve stresses through the dislocation slipping

• the recristallization determines the grain boundary size

We investigated on the above mentioned parameters on samples cold worked and heat conditioned 
and found a clear effect of the heat treatment temperature on the final loading ratio (see. Fig.4). 

Fig.5 shows three different samples:

density

treated at 800 °C for 4 hours 
c) thermal treated at 1100 °C for 0.5
hours.

density
•Fig. 5b) thermal treatment induces the slipping of the dislocation that arranges in percolative
paths.
•Fig. 5c) a too high temperature causes a too big grain growth and destroys the network formed
before.


5. Conclusions

On the basis of both the ideas examined in the introduction and the experimental activity we found
that:

•
the self-stress due to Hydrogen loading into the lattice is mostly responsible for the difficulty in
obtaining high loading ratios.

•
the maximum loading ratio achievable for each sample is strongly conditioned by the loading
dynamic

•
the initial metallurgical state of the sample can be chosen in order to minimize the growth of an
high strain field growth.

Studying both the experimental procedures and the initial metallurgical state of the sample we 
improved the reproducibility in obtaining high concentration of Hydrogen in Palladium, 
increasing the maximum loading ratio achievable in electrolysis ( c::::l H/Pd) at room temperature 
and using very low current density ( of about 10 mA/cm2). 

We obtained same results for Deuterium-Palladium system too [3]. 

These results look very promising to improve the reproducibility of the cold fusion experiment and 
to prove that the concentration threshold to overcame is a necessary and sufficient condition to 
obtain the heat excess.
