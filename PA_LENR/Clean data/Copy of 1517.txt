1. What is the potential public welfare 
benefit of CF/LENR? 

• Cheap, unlimited energy 
• Elemental transmutation 
• Other direct benefits (e.g. dispersed 
units, low O&M) 
• Many indirect benefits (e.g. reduced 
energy related environmental impacts) 


2. What is Evidence-Based Policymaking? 

• Public decisions based on facts 
• Underpinnings in realism and 
pragmatism 
• Less emphasis on ideology 
• Rational policy for the public welfare 
benefit 


3. What are the Levels of Evidence to 
guide rational policymaking? 


4. What are the policy responses for  emerging 
technologies? 


5. What is the Level of Evidence for CR/LENR 
reality? 


6. What should be the Evidence-Based 
policy for CF/LENR support? 

Policy Conclusions 
• CF/LENR should not have been rejected in the first place 
• Reinstatement is minimum rational response 
• Support with hot fusion levels is warranted 
• Crash program may now be well justified for the public 
welfare benefit 
Borrowing from the legal field… 
Assuring rational policy for new sources of energy… 
Demonstrating an increasingly stronger case… 
Basing level of support on increasing evidence…
