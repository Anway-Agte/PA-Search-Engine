1. Maximum Temperature of Hot Spot

As ,vell known, a supersonic pressure field applied to a liquicl induces the
forced oscillation of cavities. In the contraction phase of the oscillation the gas
content is greatly, adiabatically compressed and as a result a small region of high
temperature and density is transiently created in the liquid. The direct evidence
for the hot spot is provided through the sonoluminescence phenomenon.

Many experimentalists1 ,2) succeeded in directly measuring the hot-spot
temperature and nowadays it is widely believed that the temperature may reach
one hundred thousand Kelvin. On the other hand, ,ve had been interested in the
possibility of other catalyzers of nuclear fusion than muon particles. After socalled cold fusion1 we have focused on the question of what exrerne states could
be realized under ambient conditions and liavc engaged in tlie determination of
the upper bound of hot-spot temperatures.3-5)

1.1 Zeroth Order Approxoimation:
At first we assumed a gas-filled, splierical bubble and incompressible liquid. Moreover, the gas content ,vas assumed to adiabatically respond to the
motion of bubble wall. The time-evolution of the bubble radius R is, therefore1
subjected to the Rayleigh-Plesset equatio1/i
-B)

where

PL= Pc - 2CJ/R,

The p and CJ are the density of liquid and surface tension. The P0 is the ambient
pressure of liquid, PL, Pc and P 00 being pressures of liquid and gas at the bubble
wall and pressure of liquid at a remote point from the bubble center, respectively.
The gas is assumed to obey van der \Vaals' equation of states. The second term
on the right hand side of the second equation stands for an applied supersonic
field with amplitude PA and frequency J A·

The initial condition is

R(0) = Ro, .R(O) = 0.

That is, at t = 0, the bubble with radius Ro is assumed to be in a dynamical
equilibrium with the ambient pressure P0 . 

Fig. 1

We numerically solved the Raylcigh-Plcssct. equation and obtained the
ressult depicted in Fig. 1 by a broken line. The values of supersonic parameters
employed arc also iuclicatcd. It was surprising that. the maximum temperature
Tmnx of hot spot exceeded 108 I(clvin when Ro ,vas less than 10 microns. This
fact suggest eel the occurrence of hot fusion within a supersonic cavity if the gas
content is D2. The preliminary calculation was so successful that 1.
ve turned to
a more realistic model.

1.2 Compressible Liquid:
In the present paper we treat the compressible liquid, whose equation of
states is assumed to take the form of

where

P+B
Po+B

B = 3,000 atm, n ~ 7.0.

N amcly, the liquid behaves like an incompressible one when P « B. The index
n is choseu so as to reproduce the sound 1:elocity of ,vat.er, 1.45 km/s.
By use of the equations of continuity ancl of motion, and assuming the
Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis

( :t + ( c + u) :,. ) ( u22 + h) = 0'

where c and u are velocities of sound and liquid particle, respectively, and h is
the enthalpy defined as

p
h = J dP/p,

we can derive the Gilmore equation6 -s)

R(1 - u) U + � (1 - �)
U
2 = (1 + U + R (1 - U) !!_) (H - H )
G 2 3G C C C dt 00 •

The C, U and H are, respectively, values at the bubble ·wall of corresponding
quantities c, u and h. The H00 is

J
P=
H= = dP/p.

By numerically solving the above equation, we obtained t\rn solid curves 
as shown in Fig. 1. In the contraction phase of bubble oscillation, the gas-content 
may surely be subjected to adiabatic compression because of the swift contraction
of the bubble. The expansion, 011 the other hand, may occur isothermally or
adiabatically, depending on the rapidness of the process. The upper solid curve
corrcspoucls to the isothermal expansion, the lower one to the adiabatic process.
The reality may lie between two curves.

One of the most striking features of Fig. 1 is that at the transition from
incompressible liquid to compressible one Tmax decreases by a fc,v orders of
magnitude. This fact unveils that our zeroth order calculation is meaningless.
Secondly, there is a great discrepancy between the isothermal limit and adiabatic
one, that is, the diffenencc of two to three orders of magnitude over the indicated
span of R0 . It is noteworthy here that the isothermal curve still lies around 107 J(
when R0 is a few microns. After all, the isothermal expansion is found to be
indeed the one of neccessary conditions for getting high enough Tnwx to provoke
the hot fusion.

1.3 Optimization of Parameters:
Remind that there exist three adjustable parameters in the present problem, that is, the initial radius of bubble, R0 , and the amplitude and frequency of
applied supersonic field, PA and f A· It is IJoteworthy here that the smaller the
frequency f A is, the more probable the occurrence of isothermal expansion is. 

Fig. 2

Fig. 2 depicts T111
r1x against. Ro for three fixed values of the product fAxR0,
,vhere the isothermal expansion is postulated. Remarkable points of Fig. 2 arc
as follows: Three curves arc almost parallel to the R0-axis, which means that
Tmax depends on fA and Ro only through the product JAX Ro. The second point
is that, with decreasing product f Ax R0 , Tma ::r increases without the tendency of
saturation. In short, the smaller frequency f.-1 which assures, on the one hand,
the isothermal expansion of bubble supports the higher Tnwx simultaneously.
That is unexpectedly fortunate situations for us.

The Tmu.x also depends on the amplitude PA. Fig. 3 depicts Tmax versus
Ro for various values of PA. \Vith increasing PA, 1:,iax increases, but there can
be seen the apparent tendency of saturation.

2. Stability of Spherical Cavity

In this section ,ve examine the time-evolution of a small deviation from
the spherical symmetry of the bubble wall. This problem was investigated in
detail by Plesset8
). Let. the distance between the bubble center and the bubble
wall be Rs (0, ¢, t), which can be written as

Rs R+ Lalmllm,
l>l

where R is the radius of a spherical bubble and the last term ou the right haud
side describes a small deviation from the spherical symmetry. The lt rn is the
spherical harmonics. Up to the first order of the deviation paramct.cr 01 m , we
can get the Gilmore equation for R and so-called Plesset equation

R l-l(
•· a
a+ 3 Ra=� R - ) (l + l
)(l + 2
) pR2 a

Fig. 4

Fig. 4 illustrates the timc-evolutiou of R and aim over a period of supersonic field. That is, R st.arts from R0 and goes up to the maximum value
of about 10 times R0. IL the11 rapidly goes down Lo the miuimum of alJOuL 0.1
times R0. On the other hand, the deviation starts ,vith its initial ,·aluc a0, oscillates for a ,vhile and then reduces to very small values. At the fi11al stage of
the coutraction, it suddenly increases up to about 2.4 times u 0. In any way, the
deviation remains finite and therefore the bubble is proven to be stable against
a small deviation from the spherical symmetry.

In Fig. 4, only the l = 2 case is depicted. General case ,vill be given in
another place. In addition the spacial uniforrnit.y of the pressure field is assumed
in our calculation. On the other band, it is well-known experimentally that
the cavity is unstable near solid surface, that is, in the presence of spatial nonuniformity of pressure field. It is interesting, therefore, to exami11e the stability
of cavities against a small spatial variation of the pressure field.


3. Conclusion and Discussions

We calculated the maximum temperature Tmax of a hot spot which is
induced by an applied supersonic field. It is proven that the smaller the frequency JA of the supersonic field is, the higher T mu:r can be obtained, which is
indeed high enough for the occurrence of hot fusion. Especially without apparent tendency of saturation. Furthermore, with increasing amplitude PA of the
supersonic field the Tmu.r: increases with apparent saturation tendency. Finally,
the stability of spherical cavity is verified.

In our calculation, however, a lot of simplifications are made and thereby
our conclusion is still tentative and should not be laterally accepted. The following is the list of simplifying assumptions we have made: '·We considered a
gas-filled cavity but completely neglected (1) the evaporation and condensation
of vapor. Next in spite of the formation of a hot spot of high temperature and
density, (2) the thermal irradiation, (3) heat conduction and (4) mass diffusion
from the hot spot to surrounding liquid are not taken into account. Furlhermore,
the gas-content of a supersonic cavity should undergo (5) the phase transition
and execute (G) the nonadiabatic response such as the formation of shock wave.

In order for getting quantitatively acceptable results, we should engage
ourself in the calculation of Tmax by taking account of the above effects and then
we should identify the optimum experimental conditions for realizing the upper
bound of Tmax ,
