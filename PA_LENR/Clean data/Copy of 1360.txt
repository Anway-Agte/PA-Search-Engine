1. Introduction

In a model of lattice a reaction takes place within the Coherence Theory of Condensed Matter and represents a general
theoretical framework accepted by most of physicists that work on the cold fusion phenomenon. In the coherence theory of condensed matter [1] it is assumed that the electromagnetic (e.m.) field due to elementary constituents of matter
(i.e. ions and electrons) plays a very important role in the dynamic system. In fact, considering the coupling between
e.m. equations, due to charged matter, and the Schrödinger equation of field operator, it is possible to demonstrate that
in proximity of e.m. frequency ω0, the matter system is represented by a coherence dynamic system. For this reason it
is possible to speak about coherence domains whose length is about λCD = 2π/ω0.

Of course the simplest model of matter with coherence domain is the plasma system. In the usual plasma theory
we must consider the plasma frequency ωp and the Debey length that measures the coulomb force extension, i.e. the
coherence domain length. For a system with N charges Q of m mass within a V volume the plasma frequency can be
written as

ωp = Q √m !N V . (1)

This presentation is focused on the “nuclear environment” that is supposed to exist within the palladium lattice
D2-loaded and at room temperature as predicted by the Coherence Theory. In fact, when the palladium lattice is
loaded with deuterium gas, according to some people, it is possible to observe traces of nuclear reactions [2–4]. For
this reason many physicists speak about Low Energy Reaction Nuclear (LERN). Various experiments prove that in the
D2-loaded palladium lattice the most frequent nuclear reactions are [4,5]:

(1) D+D→ 3H + p + 4.03 MeV,

(2) D+D→ 4He + 23.85 MeV.

The aim of this presentation is to propose a “coherence” model through which it becomes possible to explain the
occurrence of reactions (1) and (2) and their probability, according to the most reliable experiments. The starting point
of this theoretical study is the analysis of the inner environment of the lattice, i.e. of plasma present within the lattice
itself (d-electron, s-electron, Pd-ions and D-ions), using the coherence theory of matter; the following step is based on
the effective potential reported in [6,7] by adding the role of lattice perturbations through which the computation of
the (D–D) tunneling probability improves.


2. Plasma Present within the Non-loaded Palladium Lattice

According to the Coherence Theory of Condensed Matter, in a Pd lattice at room temperature the electron shells are
in a coherent regime within a coherent domain. In fact they oscillate in tune with a coherent e.m. field trapped in the
coherent domains. For this reason, in order to describe the lattice environment, we must consider the s-electron and
d-electron plasma.

2.1. Plasma of d-electrons:
They are formed by palladium d-shell electrons. We can start computing:

ωd = e √m !ndN V (2) 

as d-electron plasma frequency. But according to the coherence theory of matter the plasma frequency is about 1.38 
and this factor is obtained assuming a uniform d-electron charge distribution. But of course the d-electron plasma is 
localized in a shell of radius R (that is about 1 Å), so the geometrical contribution is 

√6 π = 1.38. (3)

From the renormalized d-electron plasma frequency, you obtain:

ωde = 41.5 eV/! (4)

and the maximum oscillation amplitude ξd is about 0.5 Å

2.2. Plasma of delocalized s-electrons: 
The s-electrons are the ones that within the lattice structure neutralize the adsorbed deuteron ions. They are delocalized 
and their plasma frequency depends on loading ratio (D/Pd percentage) shown in the following equation (5): 

ωse = e √m !N V · ! x λa , (5) 

where 

λa = " 1 − N V Vpd# (6)

and Vpd is the volume actually occupied by the Pd-atom. As reported in [1]:

ωse ≈ x1/215.2 eV/!. (7)

For example for x = 0.5, the ωse is about 10.7 eV/!.

2.3. Plasma of Pd-ions:
Further, it is important to consider the plasma due to Palladium ions that form the lattice structure. In this case it is
possible to demonstrate that the frequency is

ωpd = 0.1 eV. (8)


3. Plasma Present within the D2-Loaded Palladium Lattice

We know that deuterium is adsorbed as soon as it touches the palladium surface. This loading can be enhanced
using electrolytic cells or vacuum chambers working at opportune pressure [8,9]. Throughout Preparata’s theory of
Condensed Matter it is assumed that, according to the ratio x = D/Pd, three phases, concerning the D2–Pd system,
reaction:

(1) phase α for x < 0.1,

(2) phase β for 0.1 <x< 0.7,

(3) phase γ for x > 0.7.

In the α phase, the D2 is in a disordered and not coherent state (D2 is not charged!). Regarding the other phases,
the following ionization reaction takes place on the lattice surface, due to lattice e.m. field:

Dlattice → D+ + e−. (9)

Then, according to the loading percentage x = D/Pd, the ions deuterium can release on the octahedrical or in the
tetrahedral sites are in the (1,0,0)-plane. In the coherence theory it is called β-plasma the deuterons plasma in the
octahedral site and γ-plasma in the tetrahedral site.

Regarding the β-plasma it is possible to affirm that plasma frequency is

ωβ = ωβ0(x + 0.05)1/2, (10)

where 

ωβ0 = e √mD $N V %1/2 1 λ1/2 a = 0.15 λ1/2 a eV/!. (11) 

For example if we use λa = 0.4 and x = 0.5 you obtain ωβ = 0.168 eV/!. 

In the tetrahedral sites the D+ can occupy the thin disk that encompass two sites. 

They present to the D+ ions a barrier. Note that the d-shell electrons oscillate past the equilibrium distance y0 
(about 1.4 Å ) thus embedding the ions in a static cloud of negative charge (which can screen the coulomb barrier). So, 
as reported in have [7]: 

ωγ = & 4Zeffα mDy2 0 ≈ 0.65 eV/!. (12)

Of course this frequency depends also on chemical condition of the palladium lattice (impurities, temperature, etc.)

Due to a large plasma oscillation of d-electrons, in the disk-like tetrahedral region (where the γ-phase D+’s are
located) a high density negative charge condenses giving rise to a screening potential W(t).

We emphasize that the γ-phase depends on x value and that this new phase has been experimentally observed [10].

The new phase γ is very important in the LERN investigation. In fact many “cold fusion physicists” declare the
main point of cold fusion protocol is that the loading D/Pd ratio must be higher than 0.7, i.e. the deuterium must be
placed in the tetrahedral sites.


4. The D–D Potential

In [6], it was shown that the phenomenon of fusion between nuclei of deuterium in the crystalline lattice of a metal is
conditioned by the structural characteristics, by the dynamic conditions of the system, and also by the concentration of
impurities present in the metal under examination.

In fact, studying the interaction between deuterons (including the deuteron–plasmon contribution) in the case of
three typical metals (Pd, Pt and Ti), a three-dimensional model showed that the height of the Coulomb barrier decreases
upon the variance of the total energy and the concentration of impurities within the metal itself.

The starting potential that links Morse-like attraction and Coulomb-like repulsion can be written in this way [6,7]:

V (r) = k0 q2 r · $ V (r)M A r % (13)

In (13), V (r)M is a Morse-like potential, and is given by:

V (r)M = B {exp (−2ϕ (r − r0)) − 2 exp (−ϕ (r − r0))} (14)

Here the parameters A, B, ϕ and r0 depend on the lattice.

In fact the D–D potential (13) is an effective potential whose reliability is shown by its own ability to fit the
Coulomb potential for r → 0 and the Morse potential in the attractive zone. Moreover, Siclen and Jones [11] defined
ρ the point where the Coulomb potential is linked by the Morse trend, r"0 the equilibrium distance and D" the well.
Certainly, within the free space for a D2 molecule, ρ is about 0.3 Å , r"0 is about 0.7 Å and D" is –4.6 eV. But within
the lattice the screening effect and the deuteron–deuteron interaction due to phonon exchange modify noticeably these
parameter values.

Considering the role of coupling between deuterons and plasmons, in [12] the authors have numerically evaluated
a D–D potential having the features of potential (13) with D" = −50 eV and r"0 = 0.5 Å and ρ = 0.2 Å (in [12] the
authors consider only two plasmon excitations at 7.5 and 26.5 eV).

4.1. The features of potential (14):
Since the screening effect can be modulated by donor atoms the role of impurities becomes considerable (as shown in
[6,7]) and has been proven that

A = JKTR (15)

and

B = J/ζ. (16)

Here J is the impurities concentration, KT is the lattice temperature, R the nuclear radius and ζ a parameter to
evaluate by fitting.

Finally the actual d–d potential can be written as

V(r) = k0 q2 r · $ V (r)M − JKTR r % . (17)

In this presentation, according to the coherence theory of condensed matter, it is emphasized the role of potential (17)
in the three different phases : α, β and γ.

So in this theoretical framework aims to clarify:

(1) what is KT?

(2) what is the role of electrons and ions plasma?

About the first point, according to the different deuteron–lattice configurations, KT can be:

(i) the loaded lattice temperature considering the deuterons in the α-phase,

(ii) ωβ considering the deuterons in β-phase,

(iii) ωγ considering the deuterons in the γ-phase.

Whereas regarding the second point, the question is trickier.

In fact the lattice environment is a mix of coherent plasmas (ion Pd, electron and deuterons plasma) at different
temperature, due to different masses, thus describing an emerging potential becomes a very hard task. The method
proposed in this presentation considers the total screening contribution of lattice environment in a D–D interaction (i.e.
Vtot) as random potential Q(t). So this model can be written as

Vtot(t) = V (r) + Q(t). (18)

And assuming that

%Q(t)&t '= 0 (19)

that is, Q(t) is now supposed to be (as a second order potential contribution) a periodic potential (the frequency will
be labeled by ωQ) that oscillates between the maximum value Qmax and 0.

rther specifically, the charge oscillations of d-shell electrons produce a screening potential having harmonic 
features:

eV (r) = −Zd ke2 2a0 r2. (20)

In [1] putting Zd = 10/3 and a0 = 0.7 Å , it is evaluated a screening potential V0 of about 85 eV. Computing this way
you get ρgV0/26.9 and, at least, ρ = 0.165 Å.

According to the loading ratio, within a palladium lattice the following cases occur.

(1) α-phase:
In the phase α the deuterons are in a molecular state and the thermal motion is about
0.02 eV < !ωα < 0.1 eV.

This phase takes places when x is less than 0.1, and since W(t) is zero, the
D–D potential is

V (r) = k q2 r · $ VM(r) − J!ωαR r % . (21)

Equation (21) has been partially evaluated in a previous page [6] but only considering the dependence of
tunneling probability on impurities present within lattice.

(2) β-phase:
When x is bigger than 0.1 but less then 0.7, phase β occurs. The interaction takes place between deuteron
ions that oscillate within the following energy values:

0.1 eV < !ωβ < 0.2 eV.

In this case W(t) is zero, so the potential is given by Eq. (22):

V (r) = k q2 r · $ VM(r) − J!ωβR r % . (22)

Comparing Eqs. (21) and (22), it seems quite obvious that the weight of impurities is more important in the
β-phase.

The role of temperature on tunneling effect has yielded to such conclusion according to the previous Refs.
[6,7].

(3) γ-phase:
Finally when the loading ratio is higher than 0.7, the deuteron–palladium system is in the phase γ.

This is the more interesting case. The deuterons undergo the screening due to d-shell electrons, therefore
the D–D potential must be calculated assuming that the wall present in potential (13), due to Morse contribution, disappears. In fact if we use a classic plasma model where the D+ ions are the positive charges and the
d-electrons the negative, it is very reasonable to suppose that the following potential must be used:

V (r, t) = k q2 r · $ VM(r) − J!ωγR r % + Q(t). (23)

We emphasize that Q(t) is an unknown perturbative potential. It should be pointed out that

%Q(t)&t ≈ Wmax/√2 . (24)

As previously said, the screening potential, due to d-electrons is supposed to reduce the repulsive barrier, i.e.
ρ and r"0.

%Q(t)&t ≈ 85 eV. (25)


5. Results and Discussions

This presentation shows the D–D fusion probability renormalized to number of events per second regarding the D–D
interaction in each different phase. More specifically, fusion probabilities in the phase α, β and γ are compared at
varying states of energy between –50 and 50 eV. It is also important to consider the role of d-shell electron screening
as perturbative lattice potential. This treatment, which considers only the case where Q(t) is different by zero, involves
a change of value of certain points in the x-axes where the coulomb barrier is represented and, in this case, the final
result is the screening enhancement of fusion probability. In order to evaluate the fusion rate (Λ) this equation was
required:

Λ = AΓ, (26)

where Γ is the Gamow factor and A is the nuclear reaction constant obtained from the measured cross sections (value
used was 1022s−1).

From an experimental point of view, in the cold fusion phenomenon it is possible to affirm that there are three types
of experiment [13]:

(1) those that give negative results,

(2) those that give some results (little detection signs are measured in contrast with the background, therefore
fusion probability is found to be about 10−23 using a very high loading ratio),

(3) those that give clear positive results as Fleischmann and Pons experiments.

Nevertheless, experiments of the third type are less accurate from an experimental point of view. For this reason it is
possible to explain only the experiments of the first and second type throughout a physical and mathematical theoretical
model of controversial phenomenon of cold fusion. In this case the role of loading ratio needs to be considered on the
experimental results.

Starting from α-phase:

In this case the theoretical fusion probability is very small, less than 10−74. It is possible to affirm that if the
deuterium is loaded with a percentage x < 0.2 no fusion event occurs. The same absence of nuclear phenomenon
is compatible for a loading ratio of about 0.7 since, in this case, the predicted fusion probability is less than 10−42.
These predictions, of course, agree to the experimental results. But for x > 0.7 a set of valid experiments on cold
fusion report some background spikes (e.g. see [14]). The remarkable result of such model is that in the γ-phase,
some background fluctuations are evident, since the theoretical predictions yielded to a fusion probability of about
10−22 due to a very high loading ratio. This represents a new result according to [6,7] since, in those cases, the fusion
probability was independent by the loading ratio.

Moreover, the model proposed in this work (which unifies nuclear physics with condensed matter) can explain some
anomaly nuclear traces found in the solids. In order to explain the occurrence of a very high fusion rate concerning
the experiments of the third type, other contribution as micro-deformation would be required as long as the experiment
itself could be possible. The role of micro-crack and impurities associated with the loading ratio will be explored in
other speculative works. Hopefully the nuclear physics within condensed matter will be a new and highly productive
scientific topic.
