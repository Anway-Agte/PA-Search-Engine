Introduction

Karly Qr' us is .revealed, that one of the mast sigr,ifi.cant, al quanticy,
proclxrt;s of nuclear reacticms in ooodensed DBlia (HID!), arising at la,
energy interactial for charse particles of }vdrogai .isotops in .radiaticm
ocmditioos w aocelerated ioos at high tall)erawres of t.ar,Jet, is the tritium
[1-3] . Tri ti.um pl.a7s the role of indicator, describing availabili 1¥ of
NIOI. If is p.reseot the sufficient quanti 1¥ of tri ti.um for sure registratial
in process experiment-means is possible to be assumed the availabilicy
of ahxmnal. nuclear reactioos, and if is not present of sure registraticm
for tritium-means and is not present menti.ooed reacticms.

The registratial cm1J, of hlgb--energy neutnms, game;--􀇒radiatiaisand
charse particles for identificatial of gi'ftD -cypes reactims is obri.ously
1U)!Q1fficleot, as far as can characterize the lmoRn bigb-eoergy processes,
it is cas,aJ arising ciJring experiment.

Last experiments al tri ti.um generaticms from metal smples, located in
enri.n:nnents of l\,droeerl .isotops, at thenal. acti:vatial receive the experimental
depenienoes for tritian generati.cm rate fram .re-tum tenperature
(Fig. 1), proporti<mal depenieooe al .i.ocrease of tritium generaticm .rate
from pressme of gas in lcmg experiments ( Fig. 2 [7]), and is sh.Jim, that optinum on tritium generation rate is in .regicn 10 % deuterium for mixes of
proti.lD-deuterium ( Fig. 3 [ 4)). At the same time, at present all proofs of
availabili t.Y NRo.l have the statistical nature, and resu1. ts of separate experiments
is not identical. Therefore, cme of main tasks, is the search and
developnent of new experimental techniques, the .Dait total accounting reve­
aled features of low energy .reactions and admi. tting unequivocal interpretati.cn
of the resu1. ts. The present work is devoted to .research of new techni -
que of experiment with rotati.cn of sanple and discussion of the theoretical
JOOdels, enabling to explain above the menti.aoed features NRo.l and gi. ve the
direction of :further researches and perspective searches


2. EXPERIMm'I'AL Dl!SIGN AND PROCEOORE

The technique of experiments an triti.tBD generations and .registration is
described early in [ 5,6 ] . 

In experiments with rotations of sanples (Fig. 
4) were used plates and cylinders :fran zirconium and niobium, thickness of
Tma

0,8 DID and diameter of·MD-182J DID. The speed of rotatioo. set in limits £ran 
0,5 to 40 rot/minuts. At .rotatioo of sanple the heating happened oo.ly for 
effect of plasma glow- discharge oo. ordinary bYdrogen (p.rotium + 0,015 % de­
ut.eri.um). 

The p,ressure of p)asmaformi.ng gas was supported in limits 
(20-60)·w3Pa. The current of glow- discharge made 2-2.5 A, and voltage 
a!D-lim V. The t.eq,arature of sanple, in location of discharge ocooentra­
tion oould reach the 't.enl>erature of melting point, that oould result in the 
instability in control and destruction of saaples. The caitrol of tri titun 
contents in plasma.forming gas was made on fulfilled technique, with error 
not exceed ::!: 50 % [5]. 


3. RHSults

The experiments an .rotating sanples oooducted, exclusively in plasna of
glow discharge oo. ordinary bYdrogen and mixes with deuterium. Not oo. enough 
large pressure,  tores and densiey- of currents, to reach of the lai:ge 
tritium generation rate, was not managed. It is possible when cyclic hea­
ting happens the tri ti.um to primar:y was &>lution in saaple, that requires 
the addi ti.anal researches. Experiments on pure deuterium with .rotation 
sanples until caiducted. The results of the JIKllSt characteristic experiments 
on tritium generation are adduced in Tab. 1. 

At execution of experiments with .rotatioo.s of sanple, in envi.ralment of 
ord.:inar.y hydrogen, the phenanenoo. of 't.enl>erature maxim.Jm displacement ahead 
on course of .rotatioo is found out. The size of this displacement is incre­
ased at increase of .rotation speed and at given parameters of glow dischar­
ge was about 5-10 mn. This displacement indicates on ocan-renoe of excess 
heat at increase of sanple teoperature and hydrogen desorption. 

Wootber is 
this excess heat by consequence of delay for convertible PI."00e5ses or this 
certificate to appearance of excess heat, arising for :reasai of irreversib­
le processes ( for exanple of :mJClear :r:eactioo.s), will be possible to found 
out afterwards neasurenerts of lEat balance installati<Xl. 


4. Discussion

The shift for area of nax:i.ml 't.enl>erature £ran heating area glow disc-
ICCF-7 

barge an appreciable size is testifies abart existence of additional pro­
cesses with allcx:atian of heat at increased tenperatures. 'Ibis can be the 
nuclear :reactions, proceeding in :zones of increased t.e:nperatm:es and suffi­
cient ocncent.rat.i.an of hydrogen. At furtrer increase of talperature the so­
lubili-cy of hydrogen decreases and reaction ceases. Early the conduct.ed ex­
per:i:nents was slDJed, that the maximal quanti-cy of tritium is formed at use 
of mixes protium-deuretium, indicates an primaey t.ri tium formation not from 
reactian D + D, and from react.ian: 
P + e + D - T (-6 keV) + v (~5,98 MeV). 

Such :record :reflects the known propert;y of hydrogen isotops to deep of 
penetrate in elect.ronic srell of CXJDnect.ed at.ans for a solid [6]. As far as 
the DBin energy in such react.ian go art. by neutrino, clearly, wl\Y to heavy 
was registered of aocoopaeying heat, ganma-radiation or neutroos. ObviaJSly 
also, the energy can be transformed in heat an]y from tritons, which, app­
roximately, 
an three order less, than is allocated in majority of thermo-­
nuclear reactions. It is possible it explains the reason of difficulties in 
receiptioos of stable the:rne.l effects. 

Fran said the i.nportant CXXJSeqUeDOe follows vezy. At work with con­
centration of deuterium in proti.um less than 10 % the main react.ian, an an­
opinion, can be the interacti.an: 
P + e + P - D (~2 keV) + v (~1,95 MeV). 

This reaction is :remarkable by theme, that the wastes are aAaY' radioac­
ti ve. 'lbe power :regi.stered of this reactian also. approxiDately will an 
three orders below. versus majority of thernoBlclear react.ions. 'lbe speed 
proceeding of such :react:i.an will be possible precisely to be det:erm:i.ned on 
aocxmpanying of tritium generati<m. rate or mass-spect.raEter nethxi, 
an 
cliange of peaks size of 3-6 nesses [2]. 

If such reactions are possible, 
then the definite probabi.li-cy of :reactions proceeding in oonderised. ned:ia 
and with relium fornatian is not excluded: 
p + e + T - 411 (-15 keV) + V (-19,8 lleV) 
-it.e (~15 eV) + p- (~15 keV)
ICCF-7 
Thls, fian features of procbrt.s received in NIDf, 
it is possible to as­
Sllllle, 
that the DBin problElll of rnclear reactions in oc:ndensed media ocm­
si.sts not in searohes energy sufficient for interact:i.cn of particles on 
knoMn mechanism ( is not p.resent of hanl radiatioo.). 
and in searohes of ap­
portunizy for radical decrease of the Caul.alb barrier in a solid, for inte­
racting of b.Ydm8en i.sotops. The offerred mechanism of fonmt:i.oo. for excess 
heat can be and not '&rln, 
IDJeYer on given staee of :researches is very im­
port.ant to be ocufi.rmed the ava:ilabili.zy for exoess hea:t Qr' calorienetry 
and to prt. oo. :reoom X-ray radiaticn. 

The reg:ist.ration of X-ray radiation 
is o:mpd smy oooditicn for proof of existence of similar mechanism NIDt.
