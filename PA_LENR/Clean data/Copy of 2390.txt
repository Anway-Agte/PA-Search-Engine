1. Introduction

While more evidences are confirming the anomalous nuclear
phenomena in deuterium/ solid system, there are still two puzzels remaining:
i.e. the penetration of Coulomb barrier at low energy, and why the process in
nuclear scale is affected by the parametric variation in atomic scale.


2. Combined Resonance Tunneling in a New Matrix Formalism

It is well known in quantum mechanics that the potential barriers in
Fig.1 may be penetrated without any reflection when the energy of the incident nucleus is in resonance with the virtual energy level of the potential well
between the barriers. The penetration may be expressed in a matrix formalism
with the new base functions at each interface between the barrier and the
well. Under the WKB approximation rn , the solutions of Schrodinger equation in regions I ,ILIILN and V may be written as
Fig.1 The Combined Resonance Tunneling of Two Barrier-Well-Barriers. 

Here k = (2µ I h ) ( E - U (x)) , p = (2µ I h ) ( U (x)-E) . µ and E are the 
mass and the total energy of the particle, respectively. h is the Planck con­
stant divided by 21t. U (x) is the potential energy. Using the WKB connection 
form be expressed in matrix form as 

Here 0 2 = exp cf• Pdx], 0 4 = exp cf Pdx], and 0 2 = 0 4 = 0 is assumed 
here in after due to the symmetry. Usually, 0 is a very large number. 
We may define a matrix. T da. to transform the cofficients in region I to the cofficients [ :: ] in region V

Jr exp [ - { kdx-i )], which correspondsto [ :: ]-[ � J When the
energy of incident particle. E. is in resonance with the meta-stable energy 
level in potential well III . then y cb = (n + ½ )1t, 
and this connection is possible, which means a perfect penetration of barrier-well-barrier combina­
tion. However. experiments do not show any evidence for this resonance en­
ergy level. Instead we propose another possible connection. i.e. the 
ba_rrier-well-barrier (abed) is combined to another barrier-well-barrier 
(efgh) by an atomic well region V Now, if the connection matrix for this combination is 
T ha =The Wed T da = ( - 1) 

This is again the right connection matrix for a perfect penetration through 
(hgfe) and (dcba) in Fig. 1. We may call this the combined resonance tun­
neling, because two semi-resonances in nuclear wells (y cb = y 111 = n1t) are 
combined by an atomic resonance well (y ec:1 = (m + ½ )1t). 


3. Semi-Resonance Energy Level in 0-0 System

We must first answer the question whether there is any semi-reso­
nance level near E=0 in Fig.1. 
Fig.2 shows the experimental data C2) 
for states of the mass number 4 with charge number 2. It is interesting to notice 
that there are two energy levels just equally above and below 23.8 MeV. ( In 
Fig.2 E = 0 has been set for 
4He ground state; therefore, E = 23.8MeV in 
Fig.2 corresponds to E=0 in Fig.1 ). The energy of these two levels are 
25.5MeV and 22.1 MeV. respectively. These two resonance levels may corre­
spond to condition 
The linear interpolation of these two levels would give 

This is just the condition for semi-reso­
nance energy level in a nuclear potential 
well.In order to obtain the combined reso­
nance tunneling, a resonance energy level 
for atomic potential well (region V 
in
