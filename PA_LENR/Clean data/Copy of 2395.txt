1. Introduction

After six years of studies on the "cold fusion" phenomenon, two facts are
established: (1) Under certain conditions there is "excess heat" of several watts per cubic
centimeter of palladium; (2) There are no commensurate neutrons, tritons, or y-radiation
in parallel with the "excess heat" which is of non-chemical origin. The regression is that:
instead of using the neutron signal to convince people to believe there is any nuclear
reaction, we attempt to explain that these two facts are due to the existence of a long
life-time nuclear resonance state inside a lattice.

Early in 1928, Gamow proved that the life-time of an a-radiation nuclide, 'ta,
was determined by the Coulomb barrier penetration number, 0 .
121 At that time the aparticle after disintegration was a free-moving particle , and 'taOC 0 2. 
Now the penetration of the Coulomb barrier happens in a reverse direction and in a different
environment: the lattice confined deuteron penetrates the Coulomb barrier and enters a
resonance state. The life-time of this resonance state, 'txh, is determined by the 0 again,
but 'txhoc 0. Now 'txh is linearly proportional to the 0 due to the discrete nature of the
energy level of the lattice confined deuteron which is different from the continuum of the
free-moving deuteron. 

We will start from the experimental evidences of this long life-time state (section
2); then, we calculate this life-time based on the nuclear resonance theory (section 3). In
order to fill this resonance state, this theory requires a critical loading ratio which is
another well-established experimental fact in the past five years (section 4). Finally, we
discuss the famous challenge of three miracles (section 5), and the conclusion (section
6)


2. Evidences for Long Life-time State

The strongest evidence is from the "heat after death" Y1 The boiling-to-dry
electrolytic cell was kept at about 100 °C for three hours without any power input. It
clearly showed that the "excess heat" source was inside the palladium deuteride. The 
reliable calorimetric calculation proved that the energy released in this 3 hours was 20 
times greater than the heat of combustion possibly released by the deuterium stored in 
this system. This was a nuclear active state with a life-time of 104 seconds. 

The second evidence is from the "heat after life".141 The SRI electrolytic cell was
a closed cell. It was not driven to boil. However, when the electrolysis was shut down, 
and input power was zero, the system did not cool down as a source-free system. The 
flow-calorimeter clearly recorded that there was an energy source inside the system. The 
first peak of the "excess power" was about 100 mW (the accuracy and the precision of 
that experiment was ± 10 mW), and the width of that peak was about 3 hours again. The 
energy released in these three hours was also about 10 times greater than the heat of 
combustion possibly released by the deuterium available in the palladium electrode. This 
was again a nuclear active state with a life-time of 104 seconds. 

During the ICCF-5, J.P. Biberian's "excess heat" data 151 showed that after the
shut down of the input power, the "excess heat" continued for 3-4 hours. Although 
there was no palladium lattice, an A1La03 single crystal provided thy lattice confined 
deuterons. Once again the life-time of that "excess heat" source was of the order of 104
seconds. 

In the "Critical Review of the 'Cold Fusion' Effect",161 E.Storms talked about the
replacing time of the palladium deuteride. When he put the deuteron-loaded electrode 
into the light water cell, he observed the "excess heat" continuing for the first several 
hours. He called this time the replacing time, because he considered that when the 
deuteride was replaced by hydride, the "excess heat" was supposed to stop. From 
another point of view, this showed that the life-time of the nuclear active state was again 
of the order of 104 seconds. 

After my talk in ICCF-5, M.Eisner of the University of Houston was so kind as 
to give me his 1989 data for the "excess heat"_l7l It clearly showed that the width of the 
first "excess power" peak after the shut down of the electrolysis was once again of the 
order of 104 seconds. 

It was not realized that the answer to Prof. J.Huizenga' s challenge of three 
miracles has been indeed implied in this long life-time of nuclear active state. 


3. Theory of Resonance Penetration for Lattice Confined Ions

The life-time of a quantum mechanical state, t, is related to the width of its 
energy level, r, by the uncertainty principle: 
The width of the energy level can be expressed by the imaginary part of the wave 
number, k;, through the identity: 
Here Im U is the imaginary part of the potential well U, kr and k; are the real and ima-
2m ginary part of the wave number k, respectively. k2 = ,[(E - U). Eis the total energy 
of the relative motion of the two deuterons. When the energy E coincides with the 
energy level inside the nuclear well, (kr a):::::: 0(1) . Here a is the size of the nuclear 
well. However for this resonance. Here 0 is defined as 
and 0 ·2 is just the famous Gamow barrier penetration factor. Equation (3) has been
rigorously proved for the square well case, 181 
and for the arbitrary potential
configuration.191 Here we just explain why the imaginary part of the wave number, k; ,
should be such a small number in order to have a resonance penetration. As we know, 
when k; < 0 , k1 determines the damping of the wave function. The wave e-,1cr will 
be damped by a factor of exp[ -lk' al] when the wave propagates through a length of a. 

On the other hand the Coulomb barrier suppresses the amplitude of the penetrating wave
function by a factor of 0 ·1. In order to use the resonance effect to build-up the wave
amplitude to its initial value in terms of the constructive interference between the 
reverberating wave and the penetrating wave, we need at least 0-times reverberation 
before the wave is damped. So we need lk' (lh)I :::; 0(1) 'or lk'al:::; oce-1).

Consequently, sustituting kr and k; in eq.(1) and (2), we have the life-time for 
"excess heat" For the d+d interaction, m:::::10-24g., a �10·13 cm, 0� 1027, 110•
The theory just gives the correct order of magnitude of the life-time of the nuclear active 
state. 


4. Bose Condensation and the Critical Loading Ratio

Such a long life-time state corresponds to a very narrow energy level in the order 
of 10·19 eV. This is the reason why we could not observe this resonance level in any low 
energy beam-target experimentY21 Because the beam energy distribution is much wider 
than the width of the resonance energy level, it is an analogy to using a screw driver to 
detect a tiny crack in a brick wall. The crystal lattice assists in observing this narrow 
resonance in two ways: (1) the trapped deuteron ion in the lattice well is sitting on a 
discrete energy level with very narrow width also; (2) the periodical structure of the 
lattice well creates an energy band for the trapped deuteron ions. Then, we have a bunch 
of needles to detect the single tiny crack on the brick wall. The number of the energy 
levels (needles) in this band is determined by the grain size, L (i.e. the size of the 
periodical structure, or the coherent length), and the size of the primitive cell in the 
palladium lattice, o (i.e. the size of the PdD molecule). When o � 3A , L::::: 60µ, we have 
roughly (L/0)3�1016 energy levels inside a deuteron energy band. On the other hand the 
deuteron energy band width, r 8, is determined by the size of the primitive cell as: 
Thus, the energy difference between each neighboring energy level inside the band is 
about 10·19 eV. Hence, if the whole band is occupied by the deuterons; then, the whole 
population has the chance to be in resonance penetration of Coulomb barrier, as long as 
the energy band is adjusted to a level in resonance with the nuclear energy level. When 
(L/0)3<<1016, we have much less chance to have resonance penetration of the Coulomb 
barrier due to the difficulty in matching the narrow nuclear energy level with the lattice 
energy level. 

Now the question is: how can we populate the deuterons into this energy band? 
We need the Bose-Einstein condensation. Experiment has shown that hydrogen solved 
in palladium acts like an ion, 1131 so deuteron should act like a boson. If the deuterons are 
totally free-moving particles like a gas inside the palladium; then, the critical density for 
Bose-Einstein condensation is aboutII4I 21th 
Energy Band 
It is much higher than the 
maximum possible deuteron density 
inside the palladium (::::6.8x 10 22 cm"3). 

However, the experiment has also 
shown that the hydrogen solved in 
palladium is not a free-moving gas. In 
order to explain the anomalous diffusion 
behavior of the hydrogen in the palla­
dium, we must assume that there is a 
component of trapped hydrogen ions 
(localized)Y51 If we assume an energy 
spectrum as that in Fig. 1, 
Fig.1 Energy Band Structure in 
Palladium Deuteride lattice 
then the critical density for Bose-Einstein condensation would be 
Eg neg = nc exp(- k T) B Using ncr6.8x10 22 cm·3 (corresponding to critical loading ratio::::l), T=300 K, we have 
this number is very close to the activation energy for hydrogen in palladium. 1151
In fact this condensation model gives a good reason for the critical loading ratio. 

If the deuteron density is lower than this critical density flcg; then, there will be no enough 
population in the low lying energy band, and less chance for resonance penetration. 


5. Nuclear Surface Absorption and o+ ➔O+ Forbidden Transition

The low energy beam-target experiments have established a fact that the strong 
interaction will annihilate the penetrating deuteron wave after several reverberations. 

When one assumes the reaction rate 
low energy experimental data show that A= 1.5 x 10-16cm3 sec-1 _1161 Considering that
the volume of the deuteron-deuteron nuclear interaction is the order of 10"39 cm3, we 
know that the life-time of the deuteron-deuteron strong interacting system is the order of 
10"23 sec, i.e. the order of the reverberation time. Then, one may ask the reason why the
built-up wave function in the resonance case is not annihilated by this strong interaction 
In fact, the strong absorption in the nuclear well is concentrated on the surface 
region as suggested by the nuclear optical modelY71 The reaction "constant", A, is not a 
constant inside the nuclear well; hence, the reaction rate, A, should be 
(I 1) 

Here, the subscripts, V and S, denote the volume and surface, respectively. Av(r) is much 
smaller than A.s{r) by a factor of 0·1. When there is no resonance, ri'v(r)I::::: l'l's(r)I ; then,
the reaction happens mainly in the surface region of the nuclear well, and the life-time is 
the order of the reverberation time. When the energy reaches the resonance level, the 
wave function, 'f'v(r), builds up due to the constructive interference between the 
penetrating wave and the reverberating wave. ri'v(r)I::::: el'f's (r)I >> ri's (r)I .Hence, 
The life-time of the state is determined by the core part of the wave function, and is 
greater than the reverberation time by a factor of 0 . 

In other words, the strong interaction annihilates only the deuteron wave near the 
nuclear surface. The deuteron wave function can still be built up inside the core of the 
nuclear well where the absorption due to strong interaction is weak. Physically, the 
absorption (i.e. deuteron loses its identity) only happens in the region where the nuclear 
force (the derivative of the nuclear potential) is large. Inside the nuclear core, although 
the nuclear well is deep, the nuclear force is weak there. So the deuteron wave can 
survive inside the core of the nuclear well. 

In contrast to the short range of the nuclear force, the electromagnetic 
interaction is a kind of long range force. One may ask the reason why the 
electromagnetic force does not annihilate the long life-time state . This is due to the 
symmetry of the system. The symmetry of the wave function of the d+d system is 
determined by their orbital motion and their spin· motion. At the low incident energy, 
only the S-wave ( orbital angular momentum l = 0 ) is dominant inside the core of the 
nuclear well. So the symmetry for the orbital motion is symmetric about the exchange of 
the two deuterons. Then, the spin motion part of the wave function should be symmetric 
also in order to keep the symmetry of the total wave function which is necessary for a 
boson-boson indistinguishable particle system. The spin for each deuteron is 1, the 
resultant angular momentum may be 0, 1, or 2. Since the state of resultant spin 1 is anti­
symmetric about the exchange of the two deuterons, it is not an allowable state. The 
resultant spin should be O or 2Y81 Consequently, the possible total angular momentum 
and parity for the d+d system is o +, or 2 +. If the resonance state takes the 0 +; then, it 
should be stable against the electromagnetic interaction. Because the ground state for 
d+d system is 0+ (helium-4), and the spin for photon (the electromagnetic quantum) is 1, 
it is forbidden to have a O+ ➔O+ electromagnetic transition due to the conservation of the 
angular momentum. 

What we have to figure out is the mechanism through which the excited d+d 
system transfers the energy to the lattice system in a slow time scale. 


6. Conclusion: Thunder without Lightning is OK

Based on above-mentioned discussion, we have seen that the long life-time 
nuclear active state may be created after the resonance penetration of Coulomb barrier in 
the d+d system in terms of the lattice confined deuterons. This is a resonance state which 
cannot be observed in a low energy beam-target experiment. This resonance state will 
not emit strong nuclear radiation (neutron, triton, or y radiation). This is just the answer 
to Professor J.Huizenga's challenge of three miracles. Only the chemists have a better 
chance to discover this nuclear active state in terms of calorimeter, because there is no 
strong nuclear radiation. 

Although it is a long life-time slow reaction, it is still a practically useful energy 
source. Even if only one thousandth of the deuterons inside the palladium are involved in 
this state, the "excess power" is of the order of 1 kW per cubic centimeter of the 
palladium. This is about the same as that in a fuel rod of a fast fission breeder reactor. 

In these two meanings, we say that thunder without lightning is O.K. This 
theory predicts that if we could produce the palladium with greater grain size and greater 
activation energy, it should be easier to reproduce the "excess heat" experiment.
