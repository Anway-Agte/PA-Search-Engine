1. Introduction—Imaginary Part of Potential Well

The selective resonant tunneling model has been successful in calculating three major
fusion cross-sections (d+t, d+d, and d+3He) in terms of an imaginary part in a nuclear
potential well [3,4]. In this paper we introduce another imaginary part in the crystal
potential well, in order to describe the deuterium-loading effect in experiments. It is
found that this imaginary part in the crystal potential well facilitates the description of the
current conservation, and the steady-state requirement of resonant tunneling.

“Excess heat” is a major anomalous phenomenon in deuterium-loaded metals. Various
calorimeters have been used to detect this excess heat; however, all the calorimeters have
a time constant which is on the order of 100 seconds or more. This means that if the
excess heat is a result of resonant tunneling, we have to have steady-state resonant
tunneling in order to detect the excess heat in a calorimeter. In the case of a beam-target,
this steady-state is maintained by an injected beam. Any absorption of the injected wave
in the nuclear potential well is balanced by the probability current of the plane wave
which is coming from infinity. Now in the case of the confined particle in a lattice
potential well, we have to supply the particle in the lattice potential well in order to
compensate for the absorption in the nuclear potential well. In experiments, this
supplement is maintained by deuterium-loading in terms of electrolysis or gas loading
procedures. The simplest way to describe this deuterium-loading effect is to introduce an
imaginary part in the crystal potential well. That is

Here, U1i and U2i are the imaginary part of the potential in the nuclear well and the crystal
well, respectively; and (r) is the reduced radial wave function of the confined deuteron
wave (Fig. 1). In order to solve the Schrodinger equation for (r) it is necessary to
assume the potential well in the regions I, II, and III respectively (Fig. 1). We shall find
that a pair of specific values for the imaginary part of the potential well, U1i and U2i, will
make the tunneling current maximized.


2. Model—Eigenequation

A deep square-well is assumed for the nuclear potential well in region I; and a down
shifted Coulomb potential is assumed in region II in order to show the repulsion between
two positively charged nuclei and the electron screening effect in metal. Beyond region II,
the potential is assumed to be constant in order to confine the charged particle and show
the effect of reflections in the lattice potential well.

To satisfy the boundary conditions at r =0 and r =, the reduced radial wave function
in region I, II, and III should be in the following form:

Figure. 1. A square nuclear well is surrounded by a Coulomb barrier. The Coulomb potential
is shifted down by Usc, the screening potential. It forms a lattice well on the right of the
Coulomb barrier.

Here, the wave number in each region is defined by the potential U1, U2, and U3 as:
For simplicity, we have assumed U3r=0, and U3i=U2i. F0(r), and G0(r) are the regular
and the irregular Coulomb wave function, respectively [5]. For the low incident energy,
only the lowest partial wave (S-wave) is considered here. The potentials are assumed to
be isotropic. K is the phase shift, and Tan(K) is the coefficient of the linear combination
for the wave function in region II. A, B, and D are the normalization constants in each
region, respectively.  is the reduced mass of the two interacting charged particles,  is
the Planck constant divided by 2. The continuity of the logarithmic derivative at r = r0,
and r = r1, will give two equations for Tan(K). They are:

Here,Fo '( )r denotes the derivative of Fo(r) with respect to r. Equations (6) and (7) give
two expression for Tan(K):
Tan(K) represents the coefficient of the linear combination in wave function II(r). It
gives the eigenequation:

It is noticed that r0 is much smaller than ac. is the Coulomb unit of length for
the two charged particles with electrical charge of z1e and z2e, i.e. the Coulomb potential
is much greater than the kinetic energy of the relative motion between two particles.
Hence, Fo(r0) is exponentially small, and Go(r0) is exponentially large. We may write [6]

Here, C2 is an exponentially small number
which is called as Gamow penetration factor:

Here, e is the absolute value of the electron charge; v is the speed of relative motion
between two particles. Using Eqs.(9) and (10) , the eigenequation (8) leads to a relation
between two time scales life1 and life2 (See Appendix (A.6)):

Here, life1 and life2 represent the life-time of deuteron in the nuclear potential well and in
the lattice potential well, respectively. They are defined as:

life1 and life2 measure the rate of nuclear reaction in the nuclear potential well, and the
rate of deuteron-loading in the lattice potential region, respectively.

N and L represent the flight-time of deuteron bouncing back and forth in the nuclear
potential well and in the lattice potential well, respectively. They are defined as

k1r and kr are the real part of the wave number k1 and k, respectively.


3. Probability Current Conservation—Requirement of a Steady State

Tunneling current is the most important physical quantity in the case of resonant
tunneling through Coulomb barrier by confined particles in lattice well. The normalized
tunneling current is defined as

Because of the probability current conservation for a steady state, it may be written as:
Use has been made of the equation:
Consequently,
This is the most important result in this paper which gives the normalized tunneling
current in the case of resonance. It involves the selectivity of life-time also.


4. Selectivity in Resonant Tunneling—Matching Loading Rate with Life-Time

This normalized tunneling current shows clearly the selectivity in resonance: it has a
peak at life1 When life1 or life1, this normalized tunneling current j would
approach to. It would be much smaller than the peak value jmax .

The resonance would increase the tunneling current by a factor of  at the specific life-
time, life1, with a narrow width. Figure 2 shows the peak-wise behavior for the
case of. It is noticed that this long life-time reaction rate is in the range of weak-interaction
(life1~104 sec.). The electromagnetic interaction and the strong nuclear interaction are too
rapid to have any detectable tunneling current (Fig. 2).


5. Discussion

Based only on the general Principle of Quantum Mechanics, we have proved that:

(1) Resonant tunneling selects not only the right energy level, but also the reaction rate
in the nuclear potential well. Only if the life-time in the nuclear potential well is on
the order of. There will be a maximized tunneling current which will be greater than that of non-
resonance case by a great factor of .  is on the order of 1023 or more. It is different
from the beam-target case, where the resonant tunneling would select the life-time in
the nuclear potential well on the order of
life1

(2) In the case of confined deuterons in the lattice potential well, the resonant tunneling
selects the loading-time in the lattice potential well also in order to keep a steady
state. This means that there is a matching loading rate which allows a resonant
tunneling in a steady state. This point is important in carrying out any
experiment with detectable excess heat.

(3) This selectivity in resonant tunneling implies a specific linear combination of wave
functions. It is neither a pure molecular state in lattice potential well (i.e. not the pure
Fo(r)), nor a pure excited nuclear state of 4He*(i.e. not the pure Go(r)). It is a mixture
of both molecular state in lattice potential well and the pure excited nuclear state of
4He* (i.e. the linear combination:
). This coefficient, Tan(K),
cannot be zero; but it also cannot be too large. It should be on the order of (1/ ) in
order to have a maximized resonant tunneling current. This long-life-time state has
been confirmed in experiment by 3-deuteron fusion reactions. [8,9,10,11]

(4) The electron screening effect is dependent on the temperature of the deuterium-
loaded metal [12,13]; hence, the  factor is a function of temperature as well. Hence,
in the experiment we should control not only the loading rate but also the
temperature in order to maintain the resonant tunneling state.

(5) In the early literature after 1989, the concept of fusion cross-section was used
without any consideration of the difference between the beam-target case and the
lattice confined case. In this paper we introduced an important physical quantity,
tunneling current j, to replace the concept of the fusion cross-section. In terms of
maximization of this tunneling current, we obtain the matching condition for
resonant tunneling. This matching condition includes both the energy level and the
reaction rate.
