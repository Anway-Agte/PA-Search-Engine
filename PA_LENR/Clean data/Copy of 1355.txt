1. Introduction

We have studied that within the Coherence Theory of Condensed Matter it was verified the cold fusion [1–4] phenomena.
In this theory [5] it is assumed that the electromagnetic (e.m.) field, due to elementary constituents of matter (i.e. ions
and electrons), plays a very important role on dynamic system. In fact considering the coupling between e.m. equations,
because of charged matter, and the Schrödinger equation of field matter operator, it is possible to demonstrate that in
proximity of e.m. frequency ω0, the matter system shows a dynamic coherence. That is why it is possible to speak
about the coherence domains whose length is about λCD = 2π/ω0.

Obviously, the simplest model of matter with coherence domain is the plasma system. In the usual plasma theory,
we have to consider the plasma frequency ωp and the Debey length that measures the Coulomb force extension, i.e. the
coherence domain length. In order to address the crucial issue of the nuclear fusion reaction involving the deuterons
that pack the Pd-lattice we must have a rather detailed understanding of the environment in which such nuclear process
will eventually take place.

For a system with N, charge Q and mass m within a volume (V ) the plasma frequency can be written as 

ωk = ωp = Qe √m N V . (1) 

Introducing the dimensional variable τ = ωpt we can rewrite the above equations 

φ˙ n(τ ) = 1 2 |k|=ωp n r n|αkrεkra+ − α∗ krεkra|n φn(τ ), (2) 

1 2 α¨ kr − iα˙ kr + mλαkr = i 2 ε∗ kr nn n|a|n φ∗ n (t)φn(τ ), (3) 

which, defining the state: 

|φ = n φn(τ )|n (4) 

and the e.m. field amplitude: 

A =  3 8π r dk αkrεkr, (5) 

we can rewrite 

∂ ∂t |φ = 2π 3  Aa+ − A+a  |φ, (6) 

˙ A + i 2 ¨ A + imλA = −2π 3 φ| a |φ. (7) 

If we only concentrate on one short time dynamics we can write: 

|φ(0) = |0, (8) 

then, creating a difference in Eq. (6) and using Eq. (7) with |φ = |0, we can easily obtain: 

A¨j + i 2 ... Aj = − 2π 3  0|  aj , a+ l |0, (9) Al = − 2π 3  Aj . (10) 

They have the same form of the equations of the coherence domains in the case in which: 

µ = 0, 

λ = 0,

g2 = 2π 3  , 

gc 2 = 16 27 < 2π 3 . 

Then, a solution for the ideal plasma exists. At any rate defining: 

αk = φ| ak |φ, (11) 

g0 = 2π 3 1/2 . 

In this case the coupling critical constant of the system is 

α˙ k = g0Ak, 

(12) A˙k + i 2 A¨ k = −g0αk, (13) 

so to admit the following holding quantity: 

Q = A∗ kAk + i 2 A∗ kA˙k − A˙∗ kAk + α∗ kαk , (14) 

while for the Hamiltonian’s it is easy to compute: 

E Nωp = H = Q + 1 2 A˙∗ kA˙k − ig A∗ kαk − Akα∗ k  . (15) 

With the objective of seeing if there are any externals solutions, we write 

αk = αukeiψ , (16) 

Ak = Aukeiφ, (17) 

where α and A are positive constants and uk is a complex vector. 

Changing these ones in Eqs. (12) and (13) we have: 

φ − ψ = π 2 , (18) 

α = g0 A φ˙ , (19) 

1 2 φ˙3 − φ˙2 + g2 0 = 0, (20) 

and by the condition Q = 0 (we cannot have a net charge flow in a plasma), we have: 

1 − φ˙ + g2 0 φ˙2 = 0. (21)

In this case it is easy to observe that for g0 = (2π/3)1/2 is unlikely to satisfy both Eqs. (18) and (19). 

This result means that the energy of an ideal quantum plasma does not have a minimum; in other words the ideal 
quantum plasma does not exist. 

That is not surprising because the Hamiltonian’s describes, of this plasma, a system whose amplitude oscillations 
are arbitrary, while the limit over a certain amplitude does not exist in a real plasma. 

But by: 

ξ = 1 2mωp (a + a+), 

it is easy to obtain: 

 ξ 2  = 1 mωp α2. (22) 

But in the plasma approximation as an homogeneous fluid, we suppose that our Hamiltonian’s stops have to be 
valid for the oscillations bigger than the following: 

 ξ 2 1/2 max ≈ a = V N 1/2 (23) 

that is when the plasma’s oscillations are of the same order of the inter-particle distance a. In order to create some more 
realistic models of plasma, we want to compute the breaking amplitude αmax obtained by the combination of Eqs. (22)
and (23) for a gas of electrons. Using the definition of ωp, we have: 
 
αmax = √mωp 1 3 1/3 = (ma) 1/4 e1/2 (24) 
 
taking 
 
a ≈ 2.5 Å 
 
it is calculated 
 
αmax ∼= 2.7 Å. 
 
This simple calculation shows how it is possible to change our quantum ideal plasma in a real plasma. For a plasma 
of electrons the oscillations remain very little and so a two levels model can be a good approximation (the dynamics 
only includes the first excited state). A consequence of this approximation, consisting in the reduction of the plasma in 
a homogeneous fluid, is the changing of the plasma frequency ωrmp 

ωp = Q √m N V . (25) 

Moreover, we study the “nuclear environment”, that it is supposed existent within the palladium lattice D2-loaded and 
at room temperature as predicted by Coherence Theory. In fact when the palladium lattice is loaded with deuterium 
gas, some physicists declared that it is possible to observe traces of nuclear reactions [1–3]. For this reason many of 
these physicists speak about Low- Energy Nuclear Reaction (LERN). 

One of the biggest experiments tell us that in the D2-loaded palladium case the most frequent nuclear reactions 
are [3,4]: 

(a) D + D → 3H + p + 4.03 MeV,
(b) D + D → 4He + γ (23.85 MeV).

In our work, we aim to propose a “coherence” model by means of which we can explain the occurrence of reactions (a)
and (b) and their probability according to the most reliable experiments [6]. First of all, we will start by analysing the
environment, i.e. of plasmas present within palladium (d-electron, s-electron, Pd-ions and D-ions) using the coherence
theory of matter; lastly we will use the effective potential reported in [7,8] adding the role of lattice perturbations by
means of which we compute the D–D tunnelling probability.


2. The Plasmas Present within No Loaded Palladium

According to the Coherence Theory of Condensed Matter, in a Pd crystal at room temperature the electron shells are
in a coherent regime within coherent domain. In fact they oscillate in tune with a coherent e.m. field trapped in the
coherent domains.

So we must take into account the plasma of s-electron and d-electron, in order to describe the lattice environment.

2.1. The Plasma of the d-Electrons:
Similar argumentations were proposed by Preparata’s but started from a new formulation of condense matter theory
known as Coherence Theory.

In this theory, we can visualize the plasma formed by d-shell electrons as consisting of charged shells of charge nde
(for palladium nd = 10) radius rd = 1 Å and thickness a fraction of 1 Å. The classical plasma

ωd = e √m ndN V , (26) 

as d-electrons plasma frequency. But according to the coherence theory of matter we must adjust this plasma frequency 
of a factor 1.38. 

We can understand this correction by observing that the formula (26) is obtained assuming a uniform d-electron 
charge distribution. But of course the d-electron plasma is localized in a shell of radius R (that is about 1 Å), so the 
geometrical contribution is 

 6 π = 1.38. (27) 

If we rewrite it with ωd the renormalized d-electron plasma frequency, we have 

ωd = 41.5 eV/h¯ (28) 

and the maximum oscillation amplitude ξd is about 0.5 Å. 

2.2. The Plasma of Delocalized s-Electrons: 
The s-electrons are those which in the lattice neutralize the adsorbed deuterons ions. They are delocalised and their 
plasma frequency depends on loading ratio (D/Pd percentage). The formula (28) can also be written as 

ωse = e √m N V  x λa , (29)

where 

λa =  1 − N V VPd , (30) 

and VPd is the volume effectively occupied by the Pd-atom. As reported in [5], we obtain 

ωse ≈ x1/215.2 eV/h. ¯ (31) 

For example for x = 0.5, we have ωse ∼ 10.7 eV/h¯. 

2.3. The Plasma of Pd-ions 
Further, we can consider the plasma due to the palladium ions forming the lattice structure; in this case it is possible 
to demonstrate that the frequency is Eq. (28): 

ωpd = 0.1 eV. (32) 


3. The Plasmas Present within D2-Loaded Palladium

In this section, we seek to show what happens when the absorbed deuterium is placed near to the palladium surface.
This loading can be enhanced using electrolytic cells or vacuum chambers working at opportune pressure [9–11]. By
means of Preparata’s theory of Condensed Matter it is assumed that, according to the ratio x = D/Pd, there are three
phases concerning the D2–Pd system:

(1) Phase α for x < 0.1,
(2) Phase β for 0.1 <x< 0.7,
(3) Phase γ for x > 0.7.

In phase α, the D2 is in a disordered and not coherent state (D2 is not charged).
According to the other phases, we start remembering that on the surface, because of the lattice e.m., takes place the
following reaction:

Dlattice → D+ + e−. (33)

Then, according to the loading quantity x = D/Pd, the ions of deuterium can occur on the octahedral sites (Fig. 1)
or on the tetrahedral (Fig. 2) in the (1,0,0)-plane. In the coherent theory of the so called β-plasma of Preparata’s the
deuterons plasma are in the octahedral site and the γ -plasma are in the tetrahedral.

Regarding to the β-plasma it is possible to affirm that the plasma frequency is given by Eq. (28):

ωβ = ωβ0 (x + 0.05) 1/2, (34) 

where 

ωβ0 = e √mD N V 1/2 1 λ1/2 a = 0.15 λ1/2 a eV/h. ¯ (35)

For example if we use λa = 0.4 and x = 0.5 we obtain ωβ = 0.168 eV/h¯.

In the tetrahedral sites the D+ can occupy the thin disk that encompass two sites (Fig. 3), representing a barrier
to the D+ ions. We must underline that the electrons of the d-shell start oscillating near to the equilibrium distance y0
(about 1.4 Å ) so that the static ions have a cloud of negative charge (see [5]).

Figure 1. The octahedral sites of the Pd lattice where the deuterons take place.

Then follows: ωγ =  4Zeffα mDy2 0 ≈ 0.65 eV/h. ¯ (36)


Of course this frequency also depends by the chemical condition of the palladium (impurities, temperature, etc…)

Due to a large plasma oscillation of d-electrons, in the disk-like tetrahedral region (where the γ -phase D+’s are
located) condenses a high density negative charge giving rise to a screening potential W (t) whose profile is reported in
Fig. 4.

Having mapped that Phase-γ depends on x value other can experimentally observe the new phase in [11,12], very
important in the (LERN) investigation. This is demonstrated by the fact that many of the “cold fusion physicist” declare
that the main point of cold fusion protocol is the loading D/Pd ratio higher than 0.7, i.e. the deuterium takes place in
the tetrahedral sites.

4. The D–D Potential
In [7], it was shown that the phenomenon of fusion between nuclei of deuterium in the lattice of a metal is conditioned
by the structural characteristics, by the dynamic conditions of the system and also by the concentration of impurities
present in the metal under examination.

In fact, studying the curves of the potential of interaction between deuterons (including the deuteron–plasmon
contribution) in the case of three typical metals (Pd, Pt and Ti), as shown in a three-dimensional model, the height of
the Coulomb barrier decreases on the varying of the total energy and of the concentration of impurities present in the
metal itself.

The initial potential that connects the like-Morse attraction and the like-Coulomb repulsion can be written as seen
in [7,8]:

V (r) = k0 q2 r  V (r)M −  r  , (37)

where V (r)M is the Morse potential, k0 = 1/4πε0, q is the charge of the deuteron, Md the reduced mass of the deuterium
nuclei, T the absolute temperature at which the metal is experimentally placed, J the concentration of impurities in the
crystalline lattice and R is the nuclear radius.

Figure 2. The thin disks of the tetrahedral sites of the Pd lattice where the deuterons take place.

In Eq. (37), V (r)M is a like-Morse potential, and is given by

V (r)M = B {exp (−2ϕ(−r0)) − 2 exp (−ϕ(r − r0))}. (38)

Here the parameters B,ϕ and r0 depend by the lattice.

In fact, the potential (37) is an effective one whose reliability is demonstrated by its ability to fit the Coulomb
potential for r → 0 and the Morse potential in the attractive zone. So, Siclen and Jones [12] defined ρ the point where
the Coulomb potential is associated to the Morse trend, r
0 the equilibrium distance and D the well.

Of course in the free space for a D2 molecule, ρ is about 0.3 Å, r0 is about 0.7 Å and D is −4.6 eV.

But within the lattice there are the screening effect and the deuteron–deuteron interaction, by means of phonon
exchange, modify these parameter values.

Since the screening effect can be modulated by the giver atoms, we have considered in [7,8] the role of impurities
and it has been shown that we can write J = J0 exp[β/bkT ].

Further, could occur some particular reactions, incorporating the impurities in the nucleus of the dislocations, as a
result of the different arrangement of the atoms with respect to that of the unperturbed lattice.

Figure 3. Possible d-electron plasma oscillation in a Pd lattice.

Figure 4. The profile of the electrostatic potential in a arbitrarily direction η

This type of process has been extensively studied in the literature for metals and for the case of crystalline semiconductors 
at high temperature.

In the latter, for example, it is found that the concentration of interstitial impurities around a linear dislocation, with
a point component, depends on the temperature according to the law written above where J0 is the concentration of
impurities in the zone with zero internal pressure, (b3 vi) the volume of the ions constituting the lattice, while β is
proportional to the difference (vd − vi) between the volume of the impurity atoms and that of the lattice ions.

Our conjecture is that in a metal, such as Pd, a similar phenomenon could occur between the atoms of deuterium
penetrating the lattice as a result of deuterium loading and the microcracks produced by variations in temperature. In
this case, the parameter β of the previous expression would be negative, determining an increase in the concentration
of deuterons in the vicinity of the microcrack, which would then catalyse the phenomenon of fusion as:

 = JKTR (39)

and 

B = J/ς. 

So we can write the effective d–d potential 

V (r) = k0 q2 r  V (r)M − JKTR r  , (40)

Figure 5. Plasmon exchanges. Solid lines indicate deuterons and wiggly lines plasmons.

where V (r)M is the Morse potential, k0 = 1/4πε0, q is the charge of the deuteron, Md the reduced mass of the deuterium
nuclei, T the absolute temperature at which the metal is experimentally placed, J the concentration of impurities in the
crystalline lattice and R is the nuclear radius.

Considering the attractive force, due to the exchange of plasmons, the main contribution are those (Fig. 5):

Taking into account the role of coupling between deuteron and plasmons, in [13] it was numerically evaluated a
D–D potential having the features of the potential (14) with D = −50 eV and r0 = 0.5 Å and ρ = 0.2 Å (remember
that in [13] are considered only two plasmon excitations at 7.5 and 26.5 eV).

The feature of the potential (37) is shown in Fig. 6:

According to the coherence theory of condensed matter, we study the role of potential (40) in the three different
phases : α, β and γ .

This section, however, needs of some important explanation, such as:

(1) what KT is,;
(2) what is the role of electrons, ions plasma?

Concerning with the first point, according to the different deuteron-lattice configurations, KT can be:

(1) the loaded lattice temperature if we consider the deuterons in the α-phase;
(2) ωβ if we consider the deuterons in β-phase;
(3) ωγ if we consider the deuterons in the γ -phase;

The question is much more complicate for the second point. In fact the lattice environment is a combination of coherent
plasmas (ion Pd, electron and deuterons plasma) at different temperature, due to different masses, that let be very
difficult the description of the emerging potential.

Figure 6. The solid line shows the features of potential (37) computed in order to obtain D = −50 eV and ρ = 0.165 Å. The Coulomb potential
in dashed line is computed using a screening constant of 85 eV. In the x-axis is reported the distance in Bohr radius unit and on the y-axis the energy
in eV.

The method that in this work we propose is the following: to consider the total screening contribution of lattice
environment at D–D interaction (i.e. Vtot) as random potential Q(t). So in this model we have

Vtot(t) = V (r) + Q(t). (41) 

Of course we assume that 

Q(t)t = 0 (42) 

that is to say that Q(t) (a second order potential contribution) is a periodic potential (the frequency will be called by 
ωQ) that oscillates between the maximum value Qmax and 0. 

More exactly the oscillation charges of d-shell produce a screening potential having a harmonic feature: 

eV (r) = −Zd ke2 2a0 r2. (43)

In [5] putting Zd = 10/3 and a0 = 0.7 Å, it is evaluated a screening potential V0 of about 85 eV. In this way we can
compute ρ = V0/26.9 and at last ρ = 0.165 Å. To summarize, we can have the following cases in a palladium lattice
according to the loading ratio:

4.1. α-Phase:
In the phase α the deuterons are in a molecular state and the thermal motion is about:

0.02 eV < hω¯ α < 0.1 eV

This phase takes places when x is fewer than 0.1, and since W (t) is zero, the D–D potential is 

V (r) = k q2 r  VM(r) − J hω¯ αR r  . (44)

The expression (44) was partially evaluated in the previous paper [7]; in fact, we were only interested in the dependence
of the tunnelling probability on impurities present within lattice. Through this work, we seek to examine the correlation
between potential features and loading ratio and in the paragraph 5 we showed some numerical results.

4.2. β-Phase:
When x is bigger than 0.1 but fewer than 0.7, the phase-β happens. The interaction takes place among deuteron ions
that oscillate between the following energy values:

0.1 eV < hωβ < 0.2 eV.

In this case W (t) is zero, we give this expression to the potential

V (r) = k q2 r  VM(r) − J hω¯ βR r  . (45)


Comparing the expressions (44) and (45), it seems clear that the weight of impurities is more important in the β-phase.
Of course, this conclusion deals with the previous papers [7,8] in which we studied the role of temperature on tunnelling
effect.

Table 1. For Pd “Impure” (J ≈ 0.75%), using the α-phase potential (44), has been computed the fusion
probability normalized to the number of event/s for different values of energy (−50 eV < E < 50 eV)
(Palladium J ≈ 0.75%, ρ ≈ 0.34 Å, r0 = 0.7 Å, D = −50 eV)

4.3. γ -Phase:
Lastly, when the loading ratio is higher than 0.7, the deuteron–palladium system is in the phase-γ .

This is the most interesting case. The deuterons cross the screening through the d-electrons shell, in this sense we
did a numeric simulation where we suppose that the D–D potential must be computed assuming that the well present
in potential (37), because of the Morse contribution, disappears. In fact if we use a classical plasma model where the
D+ ions are the positive charge and the d-electrons the negative one, it is very “realistic” to use the following potential:

V (r, t) = k q2 r  VM(r) − J hω¯ γ R r  + Q(t), (46)

where Q(t) is a not known perturbative potential. About this we can also add that 

Q(t)t ≈ Wmax √2 . (47) 

As said previously, we suppose that it is the screening potential, because of the d-electrons, has the role to reduce 
the repulsive barrier, i.e. ρ and r 0. In the next evaluation it is given 

Q(t)t ≈ 85 eV. (48)


5. Conclusion

The aim of this section is to present the D–D fusion probability normalized to number of events per second regarding
the D–D interaction in all different phases. More exactly, we seek to compare, at the varying of energy between –50 and
50 eV, the fusion probability in the phases α, β and γ . We also consider the role of d-electrons screening as perturbative
lattice potential.

This treatment, which only interests the case where Q(t) is different from zero, involves the change of the value of
the point on the x-axis where the Coulomb barrier takes place; in this case, the final result is that the screening enhances
the fusion probability. In order to evaluate the fusion rate () we applied this formula:

 = A, (50)

Table 2. For Pd “Impure” (J ≈ 0.75%), using the β-potential (45), has been computed the fusion probab
ility P normalized to the number of event/s for different values energy (−50 eV <E< 50 eV) (Palladium
J ≈ 0.75%, α ≈ 0.34 Å, r0 = 0.7 Å, D = −50 eV)

where  the Gamow factor and A is the nuclear reaction constant obtained from measured cross sections (value
used was 1022 s−1).


From an experimental point of view, in the cold fusion phenomenology, it is possible to affirm that there are three
typologies of experiments [14]:


(1) those giving negative results,
(2) those giving some results (little detection signs with respect to background, fusion probability about 10−23
using a very high loading ratio),
(3) those giving clear positive results such as the Fleischmann and Pons experiments.


Nevertheless, we think that from the experimental point of view, the experiments of the third point are few accurate. In
this sense, we believe that a theoretical model of controversial phenomenon of cold fusion is better to explain only those
experiments of the points 1 and 2. In this case, it is important to consider the role of loading ratio on the experimental
results. Now, let us begin from the α-phase.


In Table 1 are shown the results about the α-phase. Here we can observe that the theoretical fusion probability is very
low, fewer than 10−74. Consequently, it is allowed to affirm that through the loading, in the deuterium, of a percentage
of x < 0.2 it is not possible any fusion. The same absence of nuclear phenomenon is compatible for a loading ratio of
about 0.7 (Table 2) since in this case the predicted fusion probability is fewer than 10−42. These predictions, of course,
agree with the experimental results (for x > 0.7 look at [6]). The result of our model is that in the γ -phase, where we
can observe some background fluctuations in which, because of a high loading ratio, we predict a fusion probability at
about 10−22. This is a new result, very important for [7,8] since, in those cases, the fusion probability was independent
from the loading ratio.


To conclude, our aim is also to show that the model proposed in this paper (which unify nuclear physics with
condensed matter) can explain some irregular nuclear traces in the solids. Regarding the experiments at point 3, on the
other hand, supposing that those could be real, we want to consider other contributions as microdeformation occurrence
in order to explain the very high fusion rate. The role of microcrack and impurities linked by loading ratio will be
explored in other speculative works. “The nuclear physics within condensed matter” may be a new device through
which it is possible to understand other new productive scientific topic.


The studied problem is the objective of proposing a theoretical model considering the random city of the phenomenon
and that permits to those experiments (in which there is a high production of energy ) to be repetitive and reproductive.

Table 3. For Pd “Impure” (J ≈ 0.75%), using the γ -potential (46), has been computed the fusion proba
bility normalized to the number of event/s for different values of energy (−50 eV <E< 50 eV) (Palladium
J ≈ 0.75%, ρ ≈ 0.165 Å, r0 = 0.35 Å, D = −50 eV)

Our starting point is the following: the phenomenon of the low-energy fusion critically, depends on the interaction
between the d-d nuclear system and the D2 gas system, and the lattice of the palladium.

In fact, at the variation of the loading percentage, the typical deuterium–plasma interaction of the γ phase grows
up and so the electrostatic repulsion is weakened. But while the deuterium loading in the gas phase grows up, the
palladium lattice is deformed.

Other theoretical and experimental studies about the electric field are in progress. In order to be more clear, we
explain the main passages of the lattice reaction: firstly, we have the deformation; secondly, the dislocation; and lastly
the microcrack.

If the lattice is deformed, within the microcrack one has the creation of a microscopic electric field, in which the
D+ and the plasmons come to collision, and in which the deuterium nuclei are accelerated, as it happens in a classic
accelerator of nuclear physic. This acceleration can also generate the phenomenon of the low-energy fusion.
