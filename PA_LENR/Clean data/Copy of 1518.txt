I. INTRODUCTION

CF/LENR[A] has the potential for immense benefit as a virtually unlimited and very low cost source of energy. However, the claimed phenomenon was rejected by mainstream science within a year of its announcement by Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons in 1989. Despite continued successful experimental results and public demonstrations, CF/LENR is not yet widely accepted by conventional science. The continued rejection of CF/LENR represent a major challenge for making rational public policy for realizing its very high potential public welfare benefit. A promising way of meeting this policy challenge is to rely on evidence-based policy-making (EBP). This paper is a summary of a short presentation at the ICCF-17 poster session.


II. WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL PUBLIC WELFARE BENEFIT OF CF/LENR?

In addition to the obvious and long-recognized benefits of cheap and unlimited energy, CF/LENR has many direct and indirect side benefits. Examples of direct benefits are low capital and operation costs, ease of operation and refueling, safe and silent operation, and portable generation units. Potential indirect benefits include reduction of environmental impacts of production from conventional energy sources (e.g., coal, oil and gas, nuclear), minimal input requirements and associated impacts, ready availability of clean water in poor areas of the world, improved geopolitical conditions associated with the location of petroleum resources, and increased levels of research in a new scientific field having great economic significance. Nagel[1] has listed no fewer than 40 potential advantages and impacts of CF/LENR deployment.


III.  WHAT IS EVIDENCE-BASED POLICYMAKING? 

Evidence-based policymaking (EBP) involves making 
decisions for the public welfare benefit using factual 
information. A primary philosophic underpinning of EBP 
is realism, with a focus on actual conditions or context 
and clear-eyed acceptance of what can in reality be 
achieved. Thus a second underpinning is that of 
pragmatism – focusing on what works. Making public 
policy decisions on a particular topic based on the best 
available evidence is arguably the most rational principal 
for responsible officials. 


IV.  WHAT ARE THE LEVELS OF EVIDENCE TO GUIDE 
RATIONAL POLICYMAKING? 

Although EBP may be a superior policymaking 
approach conceptually, concrete tools are needed to 
implement the concept in the real world. One way of 
making the concept more concrete for practical 
application is to borrow terminology from the legal field 
and, to the extent possible, attach quantitative values to 
the terms. The public generally, and policymakers in 
particular (many of whom have a legal background), can 
readily relate to the following levels of evidence and 
associated probabilities when making decisions, for 
example, on whether to support an emerging technology: 


V.  WHAT ARE THE POLICY RESPONSES TO THE LEVELS 
OF EVIDENCE? 

These readily understood levels of evidence can be 
further utilized to select specific policy stances or actions 
regarding emerging technologies. The following are 
rational policy responses for the increasing levels of 
evidence of technologies having large potential public 
welfare benefit: 


VI.  WHAT IS THE LEVEL OF EVIDENCE FOR CF/LENR 
REALITY? 

The evidence for the reality of CF/LENR has 
increased greatly since it was rejected in 1989 and 1990. 
Even during the months that it was being evaluated, 
Beaudette[2] found no fewer than seven instances of 
successful 
replication 
of 
CF/LENR 
by 
different 
experimenters, methods, and laboratories during the 
period 1989 to 1991. Storms[3] conducted a review of 
experimental reports for the period 1989 to 2004 and 
found more than 300 reports of excess heat (a primary 
signature of CF/LENR), elemental transmutation, and 
anomalous radiation. And in 2011 Andrea Rossi[4] 
conducted at least six single-unit demonstrations of 
CF/LENR-based steam generating units from January to 
October leading up to a multiple-reactor (over 50 units) 
test on October 28. The single-unit tests appeared to be 
successful, 
and 
the 
multiple-reactor 
configuration 
apparently produced steam with an energy content 
equivalent to more than 70 gallons of gasoline in a 5½-
hour test with no energy input.  

In parallel with Rossi’s demonstrations, Defkalion 
Green Technologies has claimed development of reactors, 
which they call Hyperions, based on materials and 
methods similar to those of Rossi. Current plans call for 
availability of Hyperions in 2012[5]. Since Rossi’s 
apparent 2011 successes, a number of additional claims 
of 
successful 
CR/LENR 
(or 
related 
phenomena) 
applications 
have 
emerged, 
including 
Miley’s 
LENUCO[6], 
Schwartz’s 
NANOR[7], 
Brillouin’s 
CECR[8], and Blacklight Power’s CIHT[9]. 

These 
experimental 
and 
public 
demonstration 
successes may be rationally interpreted in terms of levels 
of evidence as follows: 


VII.  WHAT SHOULD BE THE EVIDENCE-BASED POLICY 
FOR CF/LENR SUPPORT? 

The level of public support for development of 
CF/LENR should rationally depend on the level of 
evidence of its existence – and its potential for realization 
as an energy source. The levels of evidence and 
appropriate levels of public support are summarized as 
follows: 

If there is not a preponderance of evidence for its 
existence, current policies of little public support may be 
appropriate. If, however, there is a preponderance of 
evidence as shown by Beaudette, CF/LENR should be 
reinstated and rigorously pursued along with other 
emerging energy technologies. If there is clear and 
convincing evidence as indicated by Storms, CF/LENR 
should receive support on a par with hot fusion as it has 
been provided n the decades since the first fusion 
thermonuclear bomb. If CF/LENR is established beyond 
a reasonable doubt as demonstrated by Rossi and others, 
a crash program comparable to the Manhattan Project 
(which resulted in development of the atomic bomb) 
should be undertaken.  


VIII.  CF/LENR POLICYMAKING SUMMARY 
The policy implications of analysis for support of 
CF/LENR for the public welfare benefit are profound. It 
seems clear that CF/LENR probably should never have 
been rejected and certainly should now be reinstated at a 
minimum. It may further be cogently argued that based 
on the successes in the years since rejection, CF/LENR 
should be pursued and supported at least on a par with 
hot fusion support – and at levels of past decades rather 
than today’s lower levels. If the demonstrations of Rossi 
and a number of others prove to be valid and sustainable, 
it is rational that a crash program should be undertaken as 
soon as possible.
