RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN FUSION ENERGY 

RESEARCH 

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 26, 1989 

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, SPACE, AND TECHNOLOGY, 
Washington, D.C. 

The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 9:45 a.m., in room 2318, 
Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Robert A. Roe [Chairman of 
the Committee] presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT A. ROE, CHAIRMAN, 


COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, SPACE, AND TECHNOLOGY 

The CHAIRMAN. The Committee will come to order. We want to 
welcome everyone to this hearing this morning. 

As the first order of business, without objection, permission is 
granted for coverage of this meeting by television, radio, and still 
photography. If there is no objection, so ordered. 

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 

In recent weeks, an atmosphere of high excitement and anticipa-
tion has permeated the scientific community as startling possibili-
ties for sustained nuclear fusion reactions at room temperature 
have emerged. The potential implications of a scientific break-
through that can produce cold fusion are, at the least, in our judg-
ment, spectacular. 

At the heart of this excitement is a collaborative experiment con-
ducted by Professor Stanley Pons of the University of Utah and 
Professor Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton in 
England. Experimental work took place on the Utah campus, and 
the announcement of results first came on March 23rd. This an-
nouncement preceded the traditional submission to a scientific 
journal where the article would be reviewed by other researchers 
in the field. Since March 23rd, researchers around the world have 
attempted to duplicate the experiments of Dr. Pons and Dr. 

Fleischmann with conflicting results, at least as reported in the 
press. 

Our objective in holding this hearing today is to examine the 
various developments to date to allow an interchange among ex-
perts with differing views and to help Members of the Science, 
Space, and Technology Committee assess the significance of the 
current information. 

The harnessing of fusion energy for eventual commercial use has 
been an illusive dream for decades, as we all know. The United 
States as well as other industrial nations have spent millions of 
dollars to fund various experimental approaches to generating sus-
tained fusion energy. All of the efforts to date have required both 
very expensive machines and extraordinary temperature levels. 

The possibility of creating fusion energy at room temperature was 
wishful thinking only a few short months ago. Today, I believe we 
all have regained new hope. 

The hope of producing commercial fusion energy is the hope of 
an energy-hungry world and the need of an energy-hungry world. 

Energy, as we all know, is the life's blood of mankind's technologi-
cal society. The Middle East has over one-half of the world's known 
oil resources and one-quarter of global natural resources—reserves, 
that is. The United States has a quarter of the world coal reserves 
and 4 percent of global oil reserves and 6 percent of world natural 
gases. What is perhaps most wondrous is that those facts may be 
superseded by man's intellectual inventiveness and dogged curiosi-
ty. 

Today, we may be poised on the threshold of a new era. It is pos-
sible that we may be witnessing the cold fusion revolution, so as to 
speak. If so, man will be unshackled from his dependence on finite 
energy resources. 

We are extremely pleased we have assembled here the two pro-
fessors who may have discovered cold fusion and certainly have 
brought great excitement to the scientific community and to the 
world. Additionally, we have with us today several recognized ex-
perts in the fields of fusion energy research and materials research 
from across the country, and I want to thank all of them for adjust-
ing their demanding schedules to be able to appear before us on 
such a very short notice. 

Without further comment from me, I would at this time recog-
nize our distinguished colleague and good friend and ranking 
Member, the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. 

Robert Walker. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT WALKER, RANKING MI-
NORITY MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, SPACE, AND TECH-


NOLOGY 

Mr. WALKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

In a period when our news seems to be filled with items telling 
us about drugs, budget deficits, the decline in America's economic 
position and environmental problems, the news of the possible dis-
covery of cold fusion in Utah, even with its accompanying contro-
versy, was wonderful news. 

If this discovery is fully proven, it will show once again the im-
portance of, supporting a vigorous small science enterprise in this 
period of large engineering and science projects. The possibility 
that cold fusion can make energy with little or no radioactive by-
products makes the prospects of this discovery even more exciting. 

If the initial results are verified, it is essential that we do every-
thing we can to develop the promise of cold fusion. In the process, 
we must ensure that this Nation does not lose out in reaping the 
potential economic benefits. 

That is why I was pleased that the Committee's Energy Research 


and Development Subcommittee accepted my amendment during 

its April 6 markup authorizing that $5 million be redirected from 
the Magnetic Fusion Program into the Basic Energy Sciences activ-
ity specifically for room temperature fusion. It is my understanding 
since that $25 million may be a more realistic kind of figure for 
this Committee to be committing to. I am fully supportive of that 
and hope the Committee will move in that direction. With this 
time and amount put together with monies from the State of Utah, 
from industry, and other places, I think we can make a real com-
mitment to the effort, and that is the very least we should be doing 
in a time when great promise is being shown. 

The discoveries at the University of Utah, if verified, will take a 
giant step toward realizing a major national goal at greatly re-
duced cost and with much less difficulty. I wish to congratulate Dr. 

Pons and Dr. Fleischmann for their hard work, and I will look for-
ward to hearing more about their efforts. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. The Chair thanks the distinguished gentleman 


from Pennsylvania and recognizes the distinguished gentlelady 

from Tennessee, the Chairman of the Energy Research and Devel-
opment Subcommittee, the Honorable Mrs. Lloyd. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARILYN LLOYD, CHAIRMAN, 


SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 

I, too, am pleased to participate in this very important hearing 
today. My Subcommittee on Energy Research and Development 
often deals with issues on a reactive nature, such as how to keep 
disasters like Chernobyl and Three Mile Island from occurring, 
how to clean up nuclear waste, and how to deal with acid rain and 
the greenhouse effect. So I can tell you that it is indeed a pleasure 
to be here today to receive testimony on cold fusion. Your presence 
here today proves that good news can make headlines. 

We are looking forward to advances in this exciting new field of 
fusion energy research, and I am sure it comes as no surprise to 
our witnesses that the race to confirm their claim is highly com-
petitive. Scientists all over the world are now trying to duplicate 
the power of the Sun because of your experiments. Hopes of devel-
oping this power that runs on limitless sea water and leaves virtu-
ally no dangerous radioactive waste have put research projects all 
over the country on hold. 

I, myself, am particularly interested in the efforts of a group of 
seven chemical technologists and eight nuclear engineers in Oak 
Ridge, Tennessee. The scientists at. the Oak Ridge National Labora-
tory have been in the forefront of nuclear fusion development by 
more traditional methods for many years now, but they are 
thrilled, and we all are, by the scientific ramifications of your ex-
perixnent. 

Gentlemen, the world awaits the crucial details of your amazing 
claim. The amount of energy that your experiment produced is 
larger than any chemical reaction that we know can justify, and 
the production of so much heat energy without a corresponding 
number of neutrons is novel, to say the least. We all want this to 
work. 

Energy is the lifeblood of our Nation, and fusion energy would be 
an enormous step toward the goal of energy independence. You can 
certainly be sure that my Subcommittee is supportive of new initia-
tives along with the rest of the Nation, and I am hopeful that 
today's revelations will move us toward a new era in fusion tem-
perature. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank the distinguished gentlelady. 

The chair recognizes the distinguished gentleman from New 
York, Mr. Scheuer. 

Mr. SCHEUER. Mr. Chairman, we have an enormous showing of 
Members today, a baker's dozen at the least. If each of us takes 
five minutes, it will be over an hour before we get to the distin-
guished witnesses. So I would ask unanimous consent that Mem-
bers from here on in be restricted to two minutes. 

The CHAIRMAN. Is there any objection to the unanimous consent 
request? None is heard. The unanimous consent is agreed to. 

The chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania, the dis-
tinguished Mr. Ritter. 


OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DON RITTER 

Mr. RrrrER. Mr. Chairman, I think I object. 

The CHAIRMAN. Too late. You've got two minutes. 

Mr. RrrrER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this impor-
tant hearing. 

A simple tabletop experiment with heavy water and electrical 
current has caused excitement to ripple through the American sci-
entific community. The discovery of cold fusion may turn out to be 
historic, and "fusion in a flask" may, in the longer term, prove to 
be a cheap, meaningful source of energy. 

I want to emphasize the fact that the money that went into sup-
porting this research is minuscule in comparison to the kind of 
large-scale mega-projects we have been dealing with over the years 
here. 

A scientist at Oak Ridge said on Monday, "We don't know 
whether we're doing the right experiment, but we're willing to 
come in at midnight and do it." What that tells me is, there's a lot 
of energy being harnessed in pursuit of cold fusion and a lot of 
energy is out there already. This is the dogged persistence of some 
of America's best and brightest scientists. 

If cold fusion works, we would be remiss if we didn't do every-
thing within our means to encourage its long-term development, 
but we need to know more. Is it indeed a nuclear reaction that's 
occurring? Does the process produce enough energy to make it 
viable in a scaled-up version? And then there's the would-be ques-
tions about our existing nuclear fusion program. There are so 
many other questions, but, in fact, it may be too early to ask them. 
"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious," 
Albert Einstein said in 1930. But bringing these mysteries into the 
home, into the marketplace, and into the production line demands 
long-term commitment, not just fanfare at the moment. We 
shouldn't forget that we sat here not too long ago and felt the in-
tensity generated by another revolutionary breakthrough: high- 
temperature superconductivity. But the Gomery report, which tells 
us how to follow through on the initial excitement over the long 
term, is still sitting on the shelf awaiting implementation. 

I've used the phrase "long-range" and "long-term" several times, 
Mr. Chairman, because it is only with patience, commitment, and 
investment that our scientific discoveries become part and parcel of 
our lives, not just fascinations and Nobel Prize-winning efforts for 
the scientific community. 

In recent years, we have been more successful in providing the 
world with scientific breakthroughs, but our competitors have been 
often more creative in putting that science to large-scale commer-
cial use. 

Mr. Chairman, I commend our witnesses for participating in this 
exciting quest. I welcome them, and I look forward to their testimo-
ny. 

Thank you. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 

The chair recognizes the distinguished gentleman from New 
York, Mr. Scheur. 


OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES SCHEUER 

Mr. SCHEUER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Mr. Chairman, the prospect of having a world in which we have 
an unlimited new, cheap, and clean source of energy is almost un-
bearably exciting. I think we are all transported here with the po-
tential of not having to worry about the polluting effects of burn-
ing fossil fuels. 

Mr. Chairman, we have had scientists appear before this Com-
mittee and, because of acid rain, global warming, the greenhouse 
effect, et cetera, et cetera, they have told us that the world has got 
to stop burning fossil fuel. Now that may not be a very practical 
prospect, but it shows how serious are the environmental problems 
which plague us. 

If we can find this new, clean source of energy, it would be a god-
send of unimaginable proportions. But I must say, Mr. Chairman, 
the process so far by which we have learned about this has been 
more confusion than cold fusion, and there seems to be a feeling 
about that the process has been more driven by a wish to protect 
future potential profits than it has been adherence to normal peer 
review processes, and I hope that we'll dispel that this morning, 
and I hope that we'll get to prove the scientific peer review process 
that will be liberated to assure us that this is actually real, which 
we all hope, and pray, and dream that it is. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. The chair recognizes the distinguished gentle-
man from Washington, Mr. Morrison. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SID MORRISON, RANKING MINOR-


ITY MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENERGY RESEARCH AND 

DEVELOPMENT 

Mr. MORRISON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

I think what Mrs. Lloyd, our distinguished Chairman of the 
Energy Research and Development Subcommittee, had in mind 
was sort of a friendly fireside chat with these distinguished gentle-
men, and we are proud to share this with, Mr. Chairman, not only 
the Full Committee but, obviously, a tremendous level of attention 
that is virtually world-wide. 

I would suggest that maybe our interest on this committee this 
morning will be, first of all, how to verify; second, how to multiply; 
third, how to apply, these findings to the problems we face in this 
Committee. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank the distinguished gentleman. 

The chair recognizes the distinguished gentleman from Califor-
nia, Mr. Packard. 


OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RON PACKARD 

Mr. PACKARD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Today, our national energy sources are inadequate at best, and 
our dependence on imported oil is not acceptable. Domestic oil ex-
ploration is fraught with many problems, and the burning of coal 
and natural gas causes world-wide environmental concerns. Cold 
fusion, a virtually inexhaustible fuel source, could certainly be the 
answer to these concerns. 

This cold fusion process also holds the promise for ending our nu-
clear waste problem. We are told that we could be on the threshold 
of a discovery that would potentially revolutionize power genera-
tion as we know it today. We also realize that further experimenta-
tion and scientific proof is necessary to validate this discovery of 
cold fusion. Yet, despite the uncertainties, we Members of the Sci-
ence Committee share the enthusiasm and the hope of the scientif-
ic community for the success of this apparent breakthrough as we 
deal with environmental and energy issues which threaten our 
Nation and the world. 

Congratulations are certainly due to both of our distinguished 
witnesses and all of our witnesses and to you, Mr. Chairman; I cer-
tainly thank you and commend you for holding this important 
hearing. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank the distinguished gentleman from Cali-
fornia. 

The chair now recognizes the distinguished gentleman from New 
Mexico, Mr. Schiff. 


OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. STEVEN SCHIFF 

Mr. SCHIFF. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Mr. Chairman, I am the newest Member of the Energy Research 
and Development Subcommittee, having just been elected to the 
Congress, and I've been impressed by the large amounts in terms of 
dollars that the Committee authorizes for fusion research, in iner-
tial fusion, and in magnetic fusion. It therefore came as quite a 
surprise to me of news reports of fusion occurring in a tabletop ex-
periment. I want to observe, however, that I am sure many of the 
greatest scientists in this country and the world were able to 
achieve breakthroughs without large Federal grants in the past, 
and therefore I'm looking forward to hearing from these witnesses 
and from the other panelists today. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank the distinguished gentleman. 

The chair now wants to recognize two of our distinguished repre-
sentatives from Utah who are accompanying our first panel, and 
first I would recognize our colleague from the Second District in 
Utah, the Honorable Wayne Owens, for some opening comments 
and to introduce his witnesses. 

STATEMENT OF HON. WAYNE OWENS, THE REPRESENTATIVE IN 
CONGRESS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT OF THE STATE OF 


UTAH 

Mr. OWENS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

I would like to hold my comments until after the second panel 
and simply introduce, if I could, the panel that is here this morn-
ing. 

The CHAIRMAN. Well, before you do that, do you want to hear 
Mr. Nielson first? 

The chair then would recognize Mr. Nielson, also from the great 
State of Utah, the Third District. 

STATEMENT OF HON. HOWARD C. NIELSON, THE REPRESENTA-
TIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE THIRD DISTRICT OF THE STATE 


OF UTAH 

Mr. NIELSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

All three Members of the House from Utah are graduates of the 
University of Utah and very proud of the University of Utah and 
for the efforts they have made. I also taught at BYU for 25 years, 
and I'll be introducing Dr. Steven Jones from Brigham Young Uni-
versity, who has been doing a lot of work in the fusion area, later. 

My interest in the commercial aspects has already been men-
tioned pretty much by the Committee, and I'll not take time to 
read my statement, I'll submit it for the record, but I am happy to 
be here in support of the cold fusion research in Utah both at BYU 
and the University of Utah and wherever else we can make a good 
effort there. 

The CHAIRMAN. If there's no objection, the gentleman's full state-
ment will appear in the record at this point. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Nielson follows:] 


STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE HOWARD C. NIELSON 

BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 


WEDNESDAY APRIL 26, 1989 

MR. CHAIRMAN: 
I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS 
COMMITTEE'S HEARING. TODAY REGARDING THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH'S 
RECENT CLAIM OF SUCCESSFULLY SUSTAINING A NUCLEAR FUSION 
REACTION AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. 


WHEN DOCTORS PONS AND FLEISHMANN MADE THEIR 

ANNOUNCEMENT JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, THE WORLDWIDE SCIENTIFIC 
COMMUNITY BECAME EXCITED ABOUT THE HOPES AND DOUBTS OF SUCH A 
DISCOVERY. 

OF COURSE, AS A UTAHN, I HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY 
INTERESTED IN THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH'S EXPERIMENT, AS WELL AS 
THE RESEARCH OF DR. STEVEN JONES OF BRIGHAM YOUNG 
UNIVERSITY, WHICH IS IN THE HEART OF MY DISTRICT AND WHERE I 
TAUGHT FOR 25 YEARS. DR. JONES HAS BEEN A LEADER IN NUCLEAR 
FUSION RESEARCH FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND HAS ALSO HAD 
SUCCESS WITH A DIFFERENT, YET SIMILAR EXPERIMENT. 

MY INTEREST IN THE COMMERCIAL PROSPECTS FOR NUCLEAR 
FUSION ARE HEIGHTENED AS A RESULT OF MY ASSIGNMENT ON THE 
HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE. RECENTLY THERE HAS BEEN 
A GREAT DEAL OF COMMITTEE ATTENTION AND INTERNATIONAL 
ATTENTION FOCUSED ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS ACID RAIN 
AND GLOBAL WARMING THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF FOSSIL 
FUELS. NOT TO MENTION FEARS OVER THE DISASTROUS ALASKAN OIL 
SPILL, OUR NATION'S INCREASING ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND THE 
RISKS OF OVER DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL. 


COMMERCIAL APPLICATION OF NUCLEAR FUSION WOULD 

CERTAINLY PROVIDE A PANACEA FOR SO MANY OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROBLEMS WHILE MEETING OUR ENERGY NEEDS WITH A VIRTUALLY 
UNLIMITED, SAFE ENERGY SOURCE. WE ALL HAVE REASON TO HOPE 
THAT THESE RECENT EXPERIMENTS PROVE COMMERCIALLY FEASIBLE. 


WHILE I UNDERSTAND THAT STANFORD UNIVERSITY HAS 

REPLICATED THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH'S EXPERIMENT, I ALSO 
UNDERSTAND THAT OTHER RESEARCHERS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO 
ACHIEVE THE SAME RESULTS AND THE SCIENTIFIC JURY IS STILL OUT 
ON THE SUCCESS OF THE EXPERIMENT AND IF IT WORKS, WHY IT 
WORKS. 

I LOOK FORWARD TO TODAY'S TESTIMONY AND I THANK YOU 
AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU HERE TODAY. 

The CHAIRMAN. The chair again recognizes Mr. Owens, our col-
league from Utah. 

Mr. OWENS. Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, we have 
before us an extraordinary event and, I think, an extraordinary op-
portunity. The event, the possible achievement of solid state fusion, 
or the so-called cold fusion, is nothing less than a miracle with all 
the elements of a miracle—surprise, exhaltation, disbelief, and 
skepticism. The opportunity could also present itself as a miracle of 
accomplishment, a chance to preserve in America an American-
born technology that will change the face of the earth. 

I would like you to hear the story first-hand from the people who 
created the story, two distinguished scholars, Dr. Stanley Pons and 
Dr. Martin Fleischmann. They will each have a written submis-
sion, Mr. Chairman, which we would ask that you would include in 
the record. 

The CHAIRMAN. If there is no objection, it is so ordered. 

The chair recognizes the distinguished gentleman from the great 
State of Utah, Dr. Pons—Dr. Stanley Pons. 

Welcome. 


STATEMENT OF STANLEY PONS, PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF 

CHEMISTRY, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH 
Mr. PONS. Chairman Roe, first I would like to thank you— 
The CHAIRMAN. Now, of all the miracles of our time, the one 
thing about those microphones is, they are not that good, so you 
have to pull them closer. 

Mr. PONS. Okay. Thank you very much. 

Chairman, first we would like to thank you and the Committee 
for the opportunity to testify here today. 

I might start by saying, while discussing new research problems 
with Martin Fleischmann in 1984, as we usually do, the problem of 
high-energy or high-pressure electrochemical phenomena was con-
sidered. We knew that measurements of hydrogen—the concentra-
tion behavior of hydrogen which had been placed in two certain 
metal lattices by electrochemical means indicated that if one were 
to try to duplicate these processes by hydrostatic means—in other 
words, hydrostatic pressures—then it was clear that enormous, 
almost astronomical, pressures would have to be applied. 

So this indicated to us the possibility of many new areas of re-
search, such as hydrogen storage implications or new synthetic 
methods, new chemical synthetic methods. The most intriguing im-
plication was the possibility that under such high energy condi-
tions it indeed might be possible to fuse light atomic nucleii, a very 
unlikely situation, but certainly the science seemed to be there to 
implicate that. 

A simple experiment was then designed and started, and a few 
months later a result was obtained in Utah that convinced us that 
we might, indeed, have demonstrated a nuclear reaction, and one 
of the present experimental devices that we used is here in front of 
you, and if I might use some slides I would like to show you a sche-
matic of this diagram. 

The CHAIRMAN. Yes, of course. 
[Slides shown.] 
Mr. PONS. The cell itself, as we are now using them, is a glass 
cylinder, a test tube, if you like, except this particular one shows a 
double wall so that we may control the amount of heat, the rate at 
which heat is transported in and out of the device. 

This square block in the center represents a palladium rod of 
metal at which the reaction occurs. 

Other devices in the cell are this item here, which is a resistive 
heater so we can—so that we can place known amounts of heat—
inject known amounts of heat into the device; this is for calibration 
purposes. We also have a thermister, which is a device which meas-
ures temperature inside the cell. We would have a similar device 
outside the cell so we can measure the temperature in the sur-
rounding bath, and we go to great care to keep the outside of the 
cell at a very constant temperature. 

Other devices are a reference electrode which may be placed in 
the cell and—let's see, I think I've mentioned all of the other—and 
an outlet to put materials in and out. 

Oh, yes, and of course we need two electrodes to run an electro-
chemical reaction, and so this—we just lost our light—no. These 
wires running across these represent a platinum anode, which is 
the other electrode in the reaction, so that current passes between 
that electrode and the center palladium electrode. 

If we could have the next slide. 

The reaction that is considered is the reduction of heavy water at 
this palladium electrode. This line represents the metal palladium 
electrode, so we can imagine that this is the metal on the right-
hand side. There's a short in this device here. So the reaction—this 
sequence here represents the supposed mechanism for the reduc-
tion of water at a palladium electrode, and B20 represents heavy 
water. An electron is pumped into this water, across the electrode 
solution interface, and the first product that is formed is quite well 
known, is atoms of deuterium that then are attached to the outside 
surface of the palladium metal, and you also release the base, the 
hydroxide ion in this case, the deuteroxide ion. 

The next process which is known to occur—and this is a strange 
process, and it has been known for many years—is the dissolution 
or the diffusion of this absorbed atom of deuterium inside the 
metal lattice. So this equation here represents the deuterium—ab-
sorbed deuterium that are moving into the metal from the—from 
the surface. 

Now there is a competing reaction, or a series of competing reac-
tions, and that is that these surface atoms may also either recom-
bine or further react through another electron transfer reaction to 
give you deuterium gas. This is the hydrogen evolution reaction—
again, a well studied and quite well known reaction. 

So we have a competition between these two reactions, and the 
activity or the concentration of the deuterium which ends up inside 
the lattice is a function of the relative rates of the first two reac-
tions. If you can decrease the rate of this last reaction as opposed 
to the first, then, of course, you would increase—or you would, 
indeed, intend to increase the concentration of the deuterium, or 
the activity of the deuterium, inside that lattice. 

The next slide, please. 

So this, again, is another cartoon showing that process. We have 
the atom then moving inside to this metal lattice. 

Now upon absorption it is well known that indeed these atoms 
diffuse in. The strange thing that happens: there is convincing evi-
dence that the single electron that is associated with this absorbed 
atom is given up to the metal lattice—that is that the deuterium 
atom on the surface moves into this metal lattice as an ion. In 
other words, we end up having a low temperature plasma of deute-
rium inside the metal instead of atoms or molecules of deuterium. 

The next slide. 

A further measurement that has been made many times and by 
many different, or by several different methods, is that you can 
measure the potential or the activity, the chemical potential, if you 
like, of the species inside and outside of the metal lattice, and, like 
I said, this has been done by a variety of techniques; and you meas-
ure the potential of the species inside and outside of the chemical—
the difference in the chemical potential as about .8 volts. While 
this is not a very large voltage—if you think in terms of a battery, 
for instance, that would not be a very large voltage, but it has very 
strong implications, or the implications of this measurement 
become enormous if we think what we would have to do to recreate 
the same situation in a chemical sense. 

On the next slide, we point out that if, indeed, you would try to—
if you were to try to obtain that same voltage by the compression 
of hydrogen gas to get that same chemical potential of .8 volts, you 
would have to exert a hydrostatic pressure of a billion, billion, bil-
lion atmospheres, tremendously high pressure. 

And, further, we see—or the point here is that also these pres-
sures—or certainly these pressures, absolute hydrostatic pressures, 
are not attained inside the metal lattice. The dissolution of this 
material, these atoms going to these ions inside the lattice, repre-
sents a very high energy process, and it is not very well under-
stood. 

We further note that we never observed deuterium gas in the lat-
tice, which means that there is little driving force to form that ma-
terial. That indicates that indeed the deuterons, these ions inside 
the lattice, are quite well shielded by the electrons in the lattice, 
and this has certain other implications which we will discuss a 
little bit later. 

The CHAIRMAN. Doctor. 

Mr. PONS. Yes. 

The CHAIRMAN. We will have to suspend at this point. They are 
on the second roll call to vote. We will vote and return immediate-
ly. 
[Recess.] 
The CHAIRMAN. When we recessed, we had to go vote, and Dr. 

Pons was in the middle of his explanation. Suppose we get our 
charts back up. Back up one chart, and go on from there. 

The chair recognizes Dr. Pons. 

Somebody just pulled the plug. 

Mr. PONS. Professor Fleischmann just remarked that we don't—
that this may happen in the twenty-first century if we are not 
careful. 

The CHAIRMAN. We've got to be careful of this. 

Dr. Pons, go ahead. 

Mr. PONS. Okay. Well, just to summarize what I've been saying, 
it appears as though—that inside this metal lattice the presence of 
this deuterium plasma inside this metal lattice gives rise to a con-
dition of very high compression by the energetics, high mobility 
due to the shielding, the possibility of many collisions because of 
the high number of the deuterons inside this lattice, and very long 
confinement times—we calculate on the order of 600 years. So we 
have then the possibility under those conditions—the possibility of 
nuclear fusion. 

The next slide, please. 

Now the normal reaction which one would consider then would 
be the fusion of deuterium deuterons inside the lattice, and, as is 
well known in physics, this normally proceeds at high tempera-
tures and high-temperature plasmas to give a tritium atom and a 
proton plus energy release or, by another possible branch approxi-
mately equal to the first one, helium-3 and a neutron, again with 
the emission of large amounts of energy. 

Now our evidence for these reactions, for this normal branching 
reaction, have been the measurement of very low levels of neutron 
flux. We had some masspectroscopic data which did not pan out to 
be very pertinent to the experiment, although we're now using it 
for other investigations of other materials that may be involved; 
the gamma ray radiation associated with this neutron coming out 
of the material and reacting with water, or heavy—I'm sorry—
light water in the surrounding water bath; tritium measurements 
of this—tritium measurements of the accumulation of this atom in 
the phase outside as it exchanges with deuterium on the surface to 
give DTO, an isotope of water; and, lastly, the calorometric meas-
urements, which I'll—Martin and I will discuss in just a moment. 

The next slide shows the evidence for the tritium. This is a beta 
ray spectrum of the solution. We extract some of the solution after 
it has been in contact with the electrode for some time, and we find 
that this spectrum appears. This spectrum represents a fingerprint, 
if you like, of the presence of increasing amounts of tritium in the 
heavy water solution adjacent to the electrode. We also notice that 
this grows in time to a limiting value, and from that we can make 
judgments as to how much and how fast the nuclear reaction is 
taking place. 

The next slide shows the gamma ray spectrum which is expected 
from the reaction of neutrons coming out of that metal lattice re-
acting with water in the surrounding water bath. The neutron 
reacts giving up—with the water, giving up a gamma ray, which is 
measured in that surrounding bath. 

Also, using dosimeters, we have measured a neutron flux which 
corresponds to about 10 to the fourth neutrons per second. 

The next slide, please. 

This table—while we do measure very low levels of these nuclear 
reaction products, we make a much more significant measurement, 
and this is our calorometric data. The table shows several impor-
tant results. 

First of all, excess heat is liberated in the reaction. We measure 
more heat coming out of the electrode, more heat coming out of the 
cell, than is injected from the outside by the power supplies, by the 
current that is passed into the electrochemical cell. 

Number two, the heat arises from a process inside the electrode. 

These data here, for instance, show that the reaction, the quantity 
of heat that comes out, takes place inside the electrode and not on 
the surface of the electrode. That is evidenced by the fact that the 
quantity of the heat depends on the volume of the electrode and 
not the surface area of the electrode. 

And, number three, the values that we attain, for instance, in 
this last column, or these last columns over here, the intensity of 
this heat, the excess heat liberated, is of such a magnitude that it 
cannot be explained by any chemical reaction. The heat generation 
continues indefinitely until the cell is turned off, and it is a con-
stant excess heat under the conditions measured here. 

And before I let—before Martin Fleischmann continues with this 
presentation, if you would allow us, I would like to say that if we 
try to explain the magnitude of the heat by the conventional deute-
rium deuterium reaction, which I showed a couple of slides ago, we 
find that we have 10 to the ninth times more energy from these 
thermal measurements than that represented by this neutron and 
tritium that we observe. 

So apparently there is another nuclear reaction or another 
branch to the deuterium deuterium fusion reaction that heretofore 
has not been considered, and it is that that we propose is, indeed, 
the mechanism of the excess heat generation. 

If I could, I would like to let Martin Fleischmann continue at 
this point. 

The CHAIRMAN. The chair recognizes Dr. Fleischmann. 

STATEMENT OF PROFESSOR MARTIN FLEISCHMANN, 


UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND 

Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Chairman, Professor Pons has given you 
the essential experimental details. Let me just point out—summa-
rize that again and then carry on. 

The investigation really falls into two parts: the measurements 
of the heat and the measurements of the expected products of the 
nuclear reaction in the tritium and the neutrons; helium-3, the evi-
dence is ambiguous; but we do see also the gamma rays which we 
expect from the neutrons. 

Now the measurement of these products of the nuclear reactions 
are extremely interesting in themselves, and many people are pre-
occupied with that particular problem on its own. It's really a prob-
lem in physics. 

From our point of view, though, we have been more interested in 
the heat release, and it is that quantification of the heat release 
and the establishment of the conditions for the heat release which 
is really the social side of our research, and I will tell the Members 
of the Committee that the social considerations have, of course, 
been very much in our mind. 

Now the experiment which Professor Pons has described to you 
is superficially simple but is actually quite difficult to carry out, 
because you have to go through a process of optimizing the experi-
ment such that you will make a significant observation. 

He has really given you the essential observations, and what I 
would just like to do in the few moments I have here before you is 
to carry out some speculation about the nature of the results and 
to try and project these results into the future and make some 
point of comparison with the more conventional approaches to nu-
clear fusion which have been researched so well and so far. 

Now the experiment design which you see in front of you here 
and which you also saw in the slide has really been developed to 
measure the heat release. It is not an experiment designed to opti-
mize the energy production, the yield of energy, with respect to the 
energy input. 

So if I may just speculate for one moment and show you the next 
slide, if you were to try and do this experiment in a more sensible 
way—the next slide, please, and lower the lights, please—you 
would—you might do it in some fashion such as that, that you had 
some type of palladium electrode in which you carry out the com-
pression, which Professor Pons has been speaking about. The gas 
would be taken away from here, pumped into something like a fuel 
cell anode, where the deuterium generated in the closed system 
would again be ionized, so that there is no production of oxygen in 
the system. 

This would be a much more energy-efficient device and underlies 
one of the results which I'll show you—one of the sets of calcula-
tions which I'll show you on the next slide and is really a hypothet-
ical energy release—I'd stress that—because it involves the recalcu-
lation of our data to project them to the condition where we can 
use a closed system rather than evolving the gas here and generat-
ing oxygen at the positive electrode. 

Well, let us look at the next slide, please, and this table of fig-
ures now contains three sets of figures. The first is the excess 
energy which we are able to generate as a function of the size, the 
diameter of the electrode going in factors of 2 here; these are rod 
electrodes, 1 millimeter, 2 millimeter, 4 millimeter in diameter, 10 
centieeters long, polarized at different current densities; that's the 
current per unit area, 8, 64, 512—there are special reasons why we 
have chosen such odd numbers—and here is the excess energy gen-
erated. 

As ygu see, it actually—it increases markedly with electrode di-
ameter, and this is for the condition where oxygen—where we 
would actually continuously decompose the heavy water. 

The second set of figures here relate to the condition where the 
energy is expressed as a percentage of the total energy supplied to 
the cell, and the third set of figures relates, in fact, to the condition 
of our speculative hypothetical cell in which we do not generate 
oxygen at the anode. 

You will see that as we increase the diameter, we can, in fact, 
get factors of 3, 4, and 8 under this limiting condition—let's just 
focus on one set of conditions—about half an ampere per square 
centimeter. A 4-millimeter electrode giving about eight times as 
much energy out—would hypothetically give about eight times as 
much energy out as we put in. But let me stress, that is a projec-
tion of our figures, but in fusion research there has been so far—
naturally, you have to project to a viable technology. This is part 


iI 

and parcel—has been part and parcel of fusion research so far, so I 
think we are justified in making such a projection ourselves. 

Well, let me just contrast this with—take the next slide and just 
contrast this with existing fusion research. 

I think this figure will be familiar to Members—some Members 
of the Committee. It is what is known as a confinement parameter 
diagram where existing fusion—high-temperature fusion re-
search—incidentally, let me correct one statement which has been 
made here today that room temperature fusion is not confined to 
the experiment which we have carried out. It is, of course, well 
known also in the field of muon catalyzed fusion, which perhaps 
Professor Steven Jones may be able to tell you something about 
this afternoon. But I'm confining my—making my comparisons 
with high-temperature magnetic confinement—results from mag-
netic confinement, not with inertial laser confinement. 

Well, in the high-temperature research, the plasma, the aim, the 
objective, is to raise the energy of the particles in the plasma to the 
order of 10 to 100 kilo electron volts. One electron volts is the 
energy which is attained by a particle when it drops to a potential 
gradient of one volt. If you like, you can convert that into a tem-
perature. We are talking about temperatures of 100 to 1,000 mil-
lion degrees centigrade because we need that energy in the plasma 
to overcome the repulsive energy of the positively charged parti-
cles, and it is know that we have to get into this corner here, and 
the other axis here is the confinement parameter, which is really 
the particle density, particles per unit volume multiplied by the 
time, and notice, please, here that the objective here is to get to 
about 10 to the 14, 10 to the 15. Here are the results for the Joint 
European Taurus, which is probably about as close as people have 
got with this particular type of fusion research. 

On here is a loop that is break-even. At that point, the system 
would be giving out as much heat as is put in but neglecting the 
energy required to drive the ancillary equipment, and inside is an-
other loop, which is called ignition, and that is the point where the 
system would be generating heat even if you disconnect it from ex-
ternal energy supplies. 

So please note the confinement parameter here, 10 to 14, 10 to 
the 15, and this enormous energy scale which is of the order 10 to 
100—well, one is really talking about energies of the order of one 
million electron volts, which is the province of physics. 

Let's look at the next slide. 

Our experiment is really radically different from that. First of 
all, the energy scale is not measured in kilo electron volts but in 
electron , volts. This is actually expressed as kilo electron volts, but 
a thousandth of a kilo electron volt is, of course, one electron volt, 
and here is—we are, therefore, at much lower energies, of the 
order of one electron volt, which is the province of a chemist. If you 
like, it is high-energy chemistry. The characteristic temperature is 
about 10,000 degrees Centigrade. 

On the other hand, the confinement parameter here is 10 to the 
36, is an astronomical magnitude. In the conventional fusion exper-
iment, it's, if you like—it approaches a billion billion, but here it's 
a billion billion billion billion, this particle—parameter is really 
vastly greater, and if I could just backtrack—could you backtrack 
one slide?—there was one point I should have pointed out to you. 

These diagrams here are always projected towards not the utili-
zation of the deuterium deuterium reactions, which are safe to use 
in this type of large apparatus, but are projected towards fusing 
deuterium and tritium in these type of Tokamak devices. Now our 
research has been somewhat guided by that previous research. 

May I go back to my slide—go forward again one slide. 

There is, incidentally, another axis on here which measures the 
dimension of the electrode, because we have shown you already 
that the results are sensitive to the size of the system. But our re-
sults here are actually expressed so the deuterium plus deuterium 
reaction—in other words, our measurements—are based on heavy 
water, not water enriched with tritium, and if you observe this, 
here's the break-even line for that reaction. These are the measure-
ments which we have done; these are the measurements which cur-
rently concern us, including this last one here, which is demon-
strated in the vessel which we have brought here today, and we 
feel confident that with the systems we are investigating now we 
would, in fact, be about the break-even point. In other words, we 
would definitely be generating more heat out than we put in. But 
we do project to the use of deuterium plus tritium mixtures. In 
which case, we feel all our systems would be above the break-even 
point, and instead of generating of the order of 100 watts per cubic 
centimeter, we might be generating 10 to 100 kilowatts per cubic 
centimeter. 

Now that is, in fact, of course—how do I switch this off so that I 
don't blind someone with it? Press the button again? It's off. 

Well, that is, in fact, the speculation. As I said, we have been—
our research has been guided by the conventional approach to nu-
clear fusion, but it is quite clear that we would not need to be 
bound by that. There are other options available for us. 

So if I could just spend one more minute on how we feel where 
we are, it is quite clear to us that a vast amount of new research is 
required. Our own view is that we want to extend the science base 
of the investigation and, in that extension of the science base, look 
for the appropriate theoretical description. 

Our work was not just a shot into the dark, as people believe. We 
were guided by reasonable theoretical formulations of what might 
be taking place. But of course those theoretical formulations must 
now be refined, and those theoretical formulations, in turn, will 
throw up many new suggestions for research, and that research 
will clearly have to be done in the whole scientific community, and 
at the same time we do feel that—confident about our results, suf-
ficiently confident that we feel we would like to start a parallel in-
vestigation—set of investigations which really go down a critical 
path towards the development of a bench-top demonstration, some-
thing like that maybe, different to this, of course—a bench-top 
demonstration of a device which gives out very much more energy 
than you put into this. 

Now what we are here today—part of our objective here today is 
to point this out to you, and those of our colleagues who follow us 
will give you the scenario for this, the reasoning, to illustrate to 
you that this would be an opportunity where science and technolo- 


LO 

gy—technological applications could be investigated at an early 
stage in parallel rather than sequentially, as has been the practice 
so far. 

Thank you. 


DISCUSSION 

The CHAIRMAN. Wayne, did you want to make a further observa-
tion? 

Mr. OWENS. No. I would like to wait until after the second panel, 
Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. All right. 

I want to thank you both for your presentation. The time is now 
for questions by Members of the Committee, and the Chair recog-
nizes the distinguished gentleman from California, Mr. Brown. 

Mr. BROWN. Gentlemen, you seem to be well aware of all of the 
implications of what you are doing and have given thought, obvi-
ously, to, as you indicated, Dr. Fleischmann, proceeding somewhat 
in parallel with looking at the developmental aspects of this while 
the science base is broadening. 

Have you given some thought to the amount of effort measured 
in terms of dollars or whatever other figure you might think is rea-
sonable for the extent of both of these kinds of things—the addi-
tional research developments that might be needed as well as the 
parallel examination of the technological aspects—the developmen-
tal aspects? 

Mr. FLEISCHMANN. It is a difficult matter to quantify these fig-
ures at an early stage, but we are well aware that it is necessary to 
investigate the parameters which control the phenomenon. These 
experiments take quite a long time. They are not—of their very 
nature, they require months and not days to carry out each indi-
vidual experiment. We have to cover the materials problems, and 
the total effort involved on the science base alone is very large 
indeed. 

There is no doubt that we should have—we will have the same 
quantitative relationship in this as in other fields of research that 
a scale—production of a scaled up device will cost 10 times as much 
as—this is the rough figure you come to-10 times as much as the 
basic research. An actual working large-scale prototype will cer-
tainly cost 10 times as much. 

Again, I think we are talking in millions of dollars for the next 
phase, of the work, and I would really like to pass that topic over 
eventually because the President of the University, Dr. Chase Pe-
terson, will be talking to you about that, and I trust that he will be 
willing to quantify that in his presentation. Yes, he will. 

Mr. BROWN. We are looking at something that appears to be a 
very low budget kind of an item. You know what you spent on this 
experiment—I doubt if it's more than a few tens or hundreds of 
thousands of dollars—and you contrast that with the half a billion 
a year that we are spending on other kinds of fusion research, and 
it represents quite a marked disparity. It would indicate, obviously, 
that we could proceed rather rapidly with this if it has the promise 
that you seem to indicate. 

Also, I suspect that research will be funded in various parts of 
the world, not just in Utah, and we can expect results coming from 
Europe, and from Japan, and other places of that sort. 

Let me just ask one additional question. There has been consider-
able criticism of your procedure here with regard to the research 
results. I'd like to have you briefly defend the process that you 
have used here—that is, the public release of the information prior 
to the publication in a journal and the fact that the lack of data 
seems to have inhibited the replication of your results in most 
cases where it has been tried. I'm sure you've wrestled with this in 
your own mind, and I'd like to hear your public explanation. 

Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Well, the first—I'd like to take this in inverse 
order. In scientific—in the process of scientific publication, it is 
common practice to release a preliminary publication before you 
write a full paper. Now there are journals which are devoted to the 
receipt of papers of this kind, and it was our judgment that it was 
appropriate to inform people at this stage about the work. 

We thought that we had given sufficient data in that prelimi-
nary publication that a cool and collected look at the paper would 
enable other people to replicate the experiment. We admit that 
there were not the experimental details there, but in a preliminary 
note there never are these experimental details, and we do now 
have fax machines and telephones which would allow people to re-
quest that information from us, and those that have, we have given 
them that advice. I reject that particular criticism. 

Now as regards the particular pattern of the release of the infor-
mation, I think I would like Professor Pons perhaps to comment on 
that rather than myself. 

Mr. PoNs. In chemistry, it is generally the situation that when 
you have submitted a paper and the paper is accepted, which was 
the case in our case, then it is okay to make an announcement. I 
think that anyone can pick up a recent issue of the Chemical and 
Engineering News and they will find announcements where some-
one has announced the following discovery or the following impor-
tant piece of research, and it is to appear in the Journal of the 
American Chemical Society in May. I mean this is a typical, very 
typical, thing in chemistry. 

I think there has been a lot of confusion because the problem we 
have had is that physicists don't do things exactly the same way. 

They, in general, will send out a publication to many of their peers 
and have it informally reviewed before the paper is submitted for 
publication. This is simply a different system that chemists do not 
use. In the case of chemistry, or in chemistry, we leave' that duty 
up to the editor of the journal. It is up to the editor to seek the 
proper peers to review that paper and then judge whether it is suit-
able for publication. So I think that is the situation that we found 
ourselves in. 

Mr. BROWN. Mr. Chairman, may I follow up for just one brief ad-
ditional questions? 

The CHAIRMAN. By all means. 

Mr. BROWN. I understand that in the case of your submission to 
Nature, which is very reputable, of course, that you felt that you 
could not provide the additional information that the reviewers 
asked for probably because of the thrust of the publicity that has 
been focused on you and so forth. Could you explain that just brief-
ly? 

Mr. FLEISCHMANN. I shall take that comment, Congressman. 

The substance of the paper which has appeared was really more 
extensive than our preliminary paper to Nature. That was even 
more restricted. Now we were given reviewers' comments by 
Nature, and, incidentally, we steadfastly refused to tell the media 
that we had submitted a paper to Nature. We have been criticized 
in Nature for revealing that information. We did not do so, and I 
emphatically say that again and again and again. We refused to 
name the journals to which we had submitted the papers. 

We got the reviewers' comments. We replied to them. Again, it is 
stated in Nature, I think this week, that we did not reply to the 
reviewers. We replied to the reviewers in detail in something like a 
19-page document. But, nevertheless, we felt that we had reached 
the stage where there was no point in writing a short paper on this 
subject, that we really need to write an extensive paper—extensive 
sets of papers, on the different Parts of our work and that this has 
to be submitted to the appropriate journals, and Nature would not 
be the appropriate place to submit this work in the form of a full 
paper; they don't publish full papers. So we decided the best thing 
to do was to say, let's leave it. 

Mr. BROWN. Nature is probably going to beunhappy with this 
decision, I imagine. 

Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Well, that is up to the editor. We don't wish 
to in any way influence—it would be totally wrong for people who 
seek to publish their work to seek to influence editorial policy. 

That is absolutely within the gift of the editor and the particular 
reviewers whom he chooses. 

Mr. BROWN. We feel the same way in Congress. We don't like to 
influence editorial policies either. 

The CHAIRMAN. And most of the time we don't. 

The Chair recognizes the distinguished lady from Tennessee, our 
Chairman of our Energy Subcommittee, Mrs. Lloyd. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 

I think that you can see by the audience here for our hearing 
today that you have generated not only the excitement of the scien-
tific community but the great populace of the country we live in 
and, indeed, the international community. 

Two of the questions that I am asked most frequently when we 
discuss your experiment: What is the possibility of demonstrating 
the net output of heat at somewhat higher temperatures where 
there would be increased thermal efficiencies in terms of useful 
energy generation? The question is, hey, can we have enough 
useful energy generation that this will be meaningful in our elec-
trical output? 


Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Well, Congresswoman LLoyd, we actually 

have had a cell boiling. We have had a cell driven up to boiling 
point. We are quite happy to tell you that here today. But, of 
course, to go beyond boiling, to generate low pressure initially—low 
pressure, higher temperature steam will require a special effort in 
technology and raises many new problems. We consider it will be 
feasible, but that is part of the question of the ongoing costs of this 
research. You certainly cannot make a high-pressure steam genera- 


LG 

tor with a device such as this. You have to go into the materials 
problems and the machining and so on. So we think it is entirely 
feasible to do that, that research can be initiated. There are many 
options open for that particular work, but it will require a very 
large effort. 

I would not like the Members of the Committee to think that just 
because we have made an initial stab at this for about S100,000 
that the ongoing research will be always in units of S100,000. A 
high-pressure steam generator, we might guess just that bit of the 
program, just the demonstration of that, will cost one to ten mil-
lion dollars. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Of course, you know that the interest of this commu-
nity is in the commercial applications of technology at all times. 

That's the nature of our work. 

The other question I'm asked as Chairman of this Subcommittee 
is: What led you to pursue this particular approach to experi-
ments? Why these particular materials, Dr. Fleischmann? 

Mr. FLEISCHMANN. That is really guided by our theoretical un-
derstanding. 

Mrs. LLOYD. In other words, why did you use palladium? 

Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Because we understand the properties of hy-
drogen and deuterium dissolved in palladium. The posing of the 
question, why can you dissolve such large quantities of deuterium 
in palladium under such extreme conditions without getting recom-
bination of the deuterium in the lattice to form bubbles of D2 gas? 
that, in itself, is, if you like, the nutshell underlying that. The theo-
retical aspects of that underlying that question is what guided us 
initially to say it wouldtbc if it is at all possible—and we realized 
that there were many difficult questions there—if it was at all pos-
sible, then palladium would be a very obvious first choice of mate-
rial. 

Now it may be that it proves to be the best choice or the only 
choice, but of course the materials aspects of this particular prob-
lem have to be fully researched again. There are other possible 
choices, other possible strategies. 

Mrs. LLOYD. As you know, many of our national laboratories 
across the country have been unable to reproduce your results. If 
other laboratories and universities cannot reproduce your results, 
will this detract from your experiments? 

Mr. FLEiscHNLANN. Well, I've expressed the view repeatedly that 


any scientific process requires independent verification. Those 

groups who are not able to reproduce the results must, in our view, 
publish details of their experimental procedure in full, just as those 
who are able to reproduce the results and extend them must pub-
lish that work. 

I have said in my presentation that it is not easy to do this work. 

The dimensioning of the apparatus is critically important, and I 
have been given access to some people's experimentation who have 
not been able to find the heat, and which has been totally unsur-
prising to me, because they would never have been able to find it 
using the apparatus they have used. But we are very happy to tell 
people how we have done it, to demonstrate our results to them, 
and what would worry me if they couldn't reproduce our results in 
our apparatus, that would worry me. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Again, I want to congratulate you, but I would urge 
you to have Los Alamos or some other one of our national laborato-
ries to go to Utah and verify your findings. 

Mr. PONS. If I might comment on that, I've been to Los Alamos; 
I've seen, again, their apparatus; they've been up to my laboratory 
once, and they are—we have set up an experiment at Utah that 
they will take away in operational form as soon as its charged up. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you very much. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank the gentlelady. 

The chair recognizes the distinguished gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania, Mr. Ritter. 

Mr. Rira.R. Mr. Chairman, having just returned from serving as 
ranking Member on another subcommittee, I would like to retain 
my position after Mr. Morrison goes. But, you know, it is indica-
tive, I was at a Subcommittee hearing on drug and alcohol rehabili-
tation and insurance, and I think it shows you some of the conflict-
ing priorities. As a scientist/congressman, I am just very, very, 
very enthusiastic about what's going on here, but the drug problem 
is a major one. 

Mr. Chairman, I would like to retain my position after Mr. Mor-
rison asks his questions and the next round goes. 

The CHAIRMAN. The chair recognizes the distinguished gentle-
man from Washington, Mr. Morrison. 

Mr. MORRISON. Thank you. Mr. Chairman. 

Gentlemen, first. I appreciate the visit to my office yesterday ,. It 
gave me an extra advantage in understanding and appreciating the 
work that you've done. 

We all recognize that there's a worldwide scramble on now to du-
plicate. to repeat, your efforts. I was wondering, perhaps a way to 
provide a very quick answer to this would be if you would be will-
ing to do the work again and let some very knowledgeable critics 
observe the efforts under your settings. Everyone is hanging on 
every word that has been published and trying to use that as the 
basis for duplicating your efforts. What if we did it again? 

Mr. PONS. As I mentioned just a moment ago. we are doing pre-
cisely that. We have 19 new experiments being set up now. One of 
those is a demonstration of a previously run experiment for Los 
Alamos. They will come up. make the measurements they want to 
make on our own system. bring their electrochemists. and let the 
electrochemists go through our method of measuring the thermal 
output. and when they are satisfied with what they see. then they 
will take that experiment away. 

I might mention that there have been other groups in the lab 
last week who have looked at the heat. looked at the data. and 
have indeed been satisfied. So we are indeed doing precisely that. 

Mr. MoRmsox. I think that will be very. very helpful. 

Also. one of the things you shared with me yesterday in response 
to my question was your suggesting that we retain and maintain 
our investment in. let's use the term "hot fusion. -  
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. I have been on record throughout as saying 
that existing programs should not be affected by the discovery of 
some new phenomenon. The existing programs are well founded in 
theory, well founded in terms of the experimental results which 
have been obtained. 

Stan Pons and I share the view that we shall need fusion, the 
generation of fusion power, in the coming centuries, probably al-
ready in the next century, and it may well be that devices based on 
the research which has been carried out so far will prove to be op-
timal for certain types of application. If our research turns out to 
be successful, it could be that it turns out to be suitable for the 
same application or a different range of applications. 

I think it would be a mistake to narrow the options on the re-
search fund. I think there will come a point in time when it is a 
question of trying to realize that as a demonstration unit and, in 
fact, to put it into commercial practice. At that point, there has to 
be clearly a decision taken on which line to pursue. But I would be 
very unhappy if the existing lines of research were affected by 
what we have demonstrated so far. 

Mr. MORRISON. There probably would be some other people who 
would be unhappy, too, Doctor, so we appreciate that. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. The chair recognizes the distinguished gentle-
man from California, Mr. Packard. 

Mr. PACKARD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

There are some discrepancies and differences between what Dr. 

Jones—Professor Jones is doing at BYU and what you have been 
doing. How do you account for those differences, and what is being 
done to reconcile those? 

Mr. Polls. I think the experiments are entirely different. I think 
that the experimental *pparatus which he is using to demonstrate 
the cold fusion process is, indeed, somewhat different, or greatly 
different than what we have done. We have designed our experi-
ments Ito look for heat during this entire period, whereas I do not 
believe that that has been the intent of his experiments. 

Mr. PACKARD. Okay. Have you done anything in terms of patent 
protection? 

Mr. PONS. The University has filed for patent protection, yes. 

Mr. PACKARD. That has been done. 

Also, you were offered and refused grants from DOE. What was 
the reason, and what is your intent in future grant opportunities? 

Mr. Ports. We made application to the Department of Energy for 
research funds early last fall. There were considerable delays in 
the review process which resulted—well, and, after all, these 
delays—we were notified that the funding would be approved. In 
March, I still had no idea as to when those funds would actually 
arrive. 

In the meantime, we had continued our investigations, continued 
funding these investigations, had asked the University of Utah for 
funding, which they had given, and we felt that, in the beginning 
of this month, that we had essentially accomplished most of the ini-
tial work which we had put into that proposal and that it would 
not be right for us at that point to take the money to do work that 
had already been done, and withdrew the proposal, submitted an-
other proposal for other research to the Office of Naval Research, 
and that funding was granted. 

Mr. PACKARD. How long do you think it would be if things went 
according to your hopes before commercialization of this process 
could become a reality? Are we looking at decades? Are we looking 
at a few years? 

Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Congressman, I think that the normal time 
scale one thinks of in terms of a commercial development is 10 to 
20 years. This experiment is more akin to chemistry than physics. 

So the time scale, I think, might be shorter than if one were 
dealing with a high energy physics experiment by it's very nature, 
because the operation is more simple. So I think we are taking the 
type of time scale one thinks of for a chemical process, which I am 
sure you can get independent corroboration of this, would be—the 
thinking would be 10 to 20 years. 

Nevertheless, as I have said, and others I am sure will indicate 
to you as well this morning, I think it is possible to envisage al-
ready one critical path to a benchtop realization, and I think while 
keeping in mind and not making any promises for less than 10 to 
20 years, the time is ripe to start immediately on that route, be-
cause others will certainly do so. 

Mr. PACKARD. Will the infusion of money enhance or shorten 
that period of time? 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Absolutely. It is totally—any commercial de-
velopment, any technological—any development of scale-up is total-
ly limited by the cash flow. You can do scientific experiments 
sometimes on the cheap, but you cannot do scale-up, you cannot do 
engineering on the cheap. That is, it would be a waste of money to 
do so. 

Mr. PACKARD. One last question, if I may, 1/4Mr. Chairman. 

In your experiment, were you able to detect or determine any 
undesirable by-products? Were there any, for example, radioactive 
waste materials or other by-products that give you concern? 

Dr. PONS. Other than the small amounts of tritium that we have 
detected, we have seen no other harmful products. We had neu-
trons at very low levels and tritium at very low levels. We have not 
detected any other radioactive material. 

Mr. PACKARD. You mentioned the neutron increase. Someone has 
mentioned—and I'm sorry that I don't have it on the tip of my 
tongue—that that may have been sufficient to have actually killed 
the experimenter. Would you explain that, please? 

Dr. PONS. Yes. We tried to point out the number of neutrons that 
we measured is extremely low, certainly very low, harmless levels. 

The amount of heat which we measure, however, is quite large. 

Now, if you try to explain that heat generation by the conventional 
deuterium fusion reaction, then yes, you would have 10 to the 9th 
times more neutrons, which would certainly be lethal. But we do 
not observe these neutrons. We do observe the heat, however, and 
we therefore propose a heretofore uninvestigated or unknown nu-
clear process that does not yield the neutrons. 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. May I just comment on that? 

Mr. PACKARD. Please, Dr. Fleischmann. 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Of course, the experiment was designed to be 
safe. It was designed taking into account the possibility of a high 
neutron flux. And when we obtained our first quantified heat re-
lease, we, in fact, discontinued that line of experiments for quite 
some time because we were still concerned that we might have a 
high neutron flux. 

But as we went along with our measurements, it became appar-
ent that there was an enormous, billion—a factor of a billion dis-
parity between the heat release and the neutron flux. 

Mr. PACKARD. So you now have no explanation as to what hap-
pens to that excess neutrons in terms of where it goes and where 
it's at during the experiment? 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. We have some idea of what is going on, but 
that requires further research. I don't think we would be too happy 
to talk about this at the present time. But equally, your comment 
about the search for other products, that is another aspect, of 
course, of the whole research which has to be carried out by us and 
by others. So far we have found nothing. There is no guarantee, of 
course, that someone, we or other people, will not fmd something 
under other conditions. 

Mr. PACKARD. Thank you very much. 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. We cannot put our hand on our hearts and 
say no one will ever find anything harmful. 

Mr. PACKARD. Thank you. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. The Chair recognizes the distinguished gentle-
man from Pennsylvania, if he's prepared. 

Mr. RITTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am at this point. 

I would be interested in knowing, was this research initially, or 
any part of it, was it funded by the Federal Government? I under-
stand about the $322,000 DOE grant. But is this a University of 
Utah initiative, or war the Federal Government involved in any 
way? 

Dr. PoNs. Not at all. 

Mr. RITTER. Not at all. 

Dr. Pow& During the entire term, we funded it ourselves. 


Mr. RITTER. This is incredible. I mean— 

Dr. Ports. I might clarify that we did use university facilities, so 
to the extent that we used the utilities and the spaces at the Uni-
versity of Utah. 

Mr. RITTER. Mr. Chairman, you're witnessing an example here 
where not all of the sweetness and light and new discoveries is 
going to come from the top five research universities in America. 

There's quite a bit out there in Utah. 


What is it about Utah that— 

[Laughter.] 
There's Howard Nielson and there's Mr. Owens. 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Shall I answer that, Mr. Chairman? 


There were certain special conditions— 

Mr. RITTER. I would be interested in hearing about that. 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Yes. First, in the mid-1970s, I—well, late in 
the 1970s, I was due to become Chairman of the Department of 
Chemistry in Southampton again, and having had a previous spell 
of this, I decided to resign. 

Now, that meant that I had free time. We had actually thought 
about this experiment before, but in order to do strange experi-
ments, you must have some free time yourself. And so I had free 
time. I had a little money. My colleague here also had some free 
money. We thought that this experiment was so strange that it 
would—that we were, in the first place, extremely unlikely to get 
any financial support, and secondly, that it was almost incorrect to 
ask for financial support for a project which had a low probability 
of success. 

Mr. RITTER. In other words, the truly creative, innovative work 
might not have been able to be supported by the Federal Govern-
ment, is that it? 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Well, we've had excellent support from the 
Office of Naval Research for strange experiments of other kinds. 

That is the organization, if I may—if you will excuse me and sing 
their praises—which preeminently has fathered and fostered inno-
vative research in the United States. 

Mr. RITTER. That's probably because they have given researchers 


some freedom— 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Huh? 

Mr. RITTER. They've given researchers some freedom, not just to 


be glancemen and to be— 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. In the small science area, in the small science 
area. 

Now, we appreciate that, but there is a sort of limit beyond 
which we did not even want to drive our friends to the limits of 
credibility. 

Mr. RITTER. There were some experiments early in the century 
that had something to do with palladium and some attempts to 
induce results such as yours. What differs between what you have 
done and what was done earlier? 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Well, that refers to tkvork of Professor Par-
nett, who was a genius, an innovative geniuil of the earlier part of 
the century. 

Mr. RITTER. He probably wasn't federally funded, either. 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Probably not. 

And while he worked initially in Germany and then in the 
United Kingdom. But that paper was subsequently withdrawn and 
the results were shown due to spurious accumulation of helium in 


the system. So he withdrew that paper— 

Mr. RrrrER. Without— 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. I hope that that is not a scenario for our own 
work. But I don't think it is. Of course, at some stage one will have 
to look very carefully into Parnett's results, because sometimes 
work is discredited and subsequently found perhaps that it was dis-
credited incorrectly. 

Mr. RrrrEE. Is the helium spurious? 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. His helium was probably spurious. I don't 
want to discuss helium too much at this stage. 

Mr. RITTER. The Stanford results are trying to explain your ex- 
perimental results on the basis of Helium-4. Is this going to be a 
"no comment" response still? 

Dr. PoNs. We certainly are investigating—this product would, 
indeed, indicate one possible further path that this fusion reaction 
might take, and that is certainly one that we are investigating. 

Mr. RITTER. One last question. Are you patenting your process? 

Is it patentable? I assume it is. Washington State seems to be pat-
enting a theory. 

Dr. PoNs. Oh, no. The State has taken out a number of patents 
on the process, and the entire research effort. 

Mr. RrrrER. My time is up. I want to commend you, I want to 
commend the University, and I want to commend the great State 
of Utah for being first. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank the distinguished gentleman. 

The Chair recognizes the distinguished gentleman from Califor-
nia, Mr. Rohrabacher. 

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I didn't know I 
was going to be next. 

First of all, congratulations to both of you for maintaining your 
composure at what must be a tumultuous time in both of your 
lives, especially in front of a hearing like this. Sometimes it gets a 
little difficult to express yourselves, and you've done very well 
today and I appreciate it. I'm sure the rest of us appreciate it as 
well. 

First of all, we just heard a question about Stanford University. 

Have the findings from Stanford University tended to verify your 
findings? 

Dr. PoNs. The experiments were quite similar. I have not yet 
seen all the experimental details, but yes, I think that could be 
considered a pretty—Yes. I think there will be testimony on that, 
as a matter of fact, later today. 

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay. 

Your support for existing programs notwithstanding, we all 


ti 

know that you've creat

e 

 d a lot of heat, not only in the beaker but 
outside the beaker afg ell. Do you think that some of this heat is 
being generated by e fact that there are a lot of people in the 
scientific community who are dependent on hundreds and millions 
of dollars worth of Government grants that may not be open 
minded towards the type of change you're suggesting is possible? 

Dr. PONS. The only comment I would make there is that I think 
it's always dangerous to point at incorrect experimental data being 
based on theory. I think theory must be used to explain experimen-
tal data, not to criticize experimental data. I mean, if it's a well-
established theory, then certainly you can raise questions. But I 
think that you need to consider first that the experimental data 
must be duplicated and explained, and then a theory put forth, 
rather than just saying your data must be wrong because the 
theory doesn't predict that. 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. I think Professor Pons is alluding to the 
nature of the criticism which has been leveled by people who are 
working in those areas of research. I don't really see that our work 
impacts too much on that work. It's another line to pursue and 
should be seen as that. 

Mr. ROHRABACHER. But you're going to put some of these people 
out of business, aren't you, if you're successful? 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Well, no. I think we will put them out of—if 
we are successful in demonstrating the science space, and if we go 
to the point of technology, then the Members of this Committee 
and the scientific community at large will start to make a choice 
about whether to develop this technology. But that technology has 
to be developed not only in competition with fusion, other fusion 
technology, but in competition with fission technology, solar 
energy, bioenergy, all other options as well. 

So I think then we are not really going to be comparing this 
device with other fusion devices. We are going to compare a source 
of—a conceivable source of energy and a conceivable development 
of a technology with all the other technologies at our disposal. 

That's going to be a different judgment, in my view, than a judg-
ment strictly within the area of fusion technology. 

Mr. ROHRABACHER. But contrary to public opinion or perception, 
isn't it true that most new, major scientific breakthroughs have not 
been—I shouldn't say most, but many major scientific break-
throughs in human history have not been greeted by the profes-
sionals of the day with open arms and— 
Dr. FLEISCHMANN. How can you expect it? I think that a strange 
piece of research will strike people as being strange. You have to 
get used to it. You have to live with it. It's like an old bicycle. You 
have to grow old with it. 

Mr. ROHRABACHER. And perhaps the fact that SO many people in 
the scientific community are now dependent on Government 
grants, that perhaps are heading in totally the opposite direction to 
achieve the same results, might actually make this problem even 
worse. 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. I hope not. I think that in the end all the 
people working in this area will come to see this as just another 
arm of the research, one they will wish to be involved in, rather 
than one they wish to stand aside from. I think if we are correct, if 
we are opening up this gray area between physics and chemistry, 
where there is this strong overlap, then the people who have got 
the big experience in the high energy physics end will have an ab-
solutely vital contribution to make. I think they will come to see 
that very shortly. 

Mr. ROHRABACHER. I hope you're right. I would like to note that 
Jonas Salk in my own time was not greeted with open arms, and 
was vilified for a certain period of time in his life, and there was a 
lot of confusion about that. I think he probably saved a lot of young 
people's lives. 

One last question. We've heard some qualifiers from you today, 
and they're justifiable. But are you still absolutely confident that 
you have discovered a new fusion process? 

Dr. PONS. Well, for five-and-a-half years I think we were our 
most severe critics, and we are still as sure as sure can be. We 
produce our data and we believe what we are seeing. So I'm sure. 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. I do not know how to interpret our results in 
any other way than that we have observed a fusion phenomenon. 

So I'm still totally convinced about our own work. But naturally, 
we shall have to look at everybody else's work as well, including all 
the unsuccessful experiments, and only time will show whether we 
are correct or not. 

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, if I could have one more ques-
tion, if this is, indeed, the opening of a new door, what do you 
think mankind is going to see as we walk through that door? Just 
a very brief summary of the new potential that this may unleash. 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Well, of course, as I said when I made my 
presentation, our motivation was social. If this is correct, then we 
have a source of energy which is clean, which avoids the pitfalls of 
generating carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide. However, let's not 
again have too rosy a view. It will have a destabilizing effect ini-
tially as it is put into practice. Hopefully, eventually it will have a 
stabilizing effect on world economies. But the adoption of such an 
energy scenario would not be without difficulties for the developed 
and the developing countries of the world. I think those raise very 
profound political questions, which I'm sure this Committee and 
other Committees of Congress will wish to address. 

The CHAIRMAN. The Chair recognizes the distinguished gentle-
man from New Mexico, Mr. Schiff. 

Mr. SCHIFF. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, gentlemen. 

I would just like to say first I appreciate the kind remarks that 
have passed back and forth between the witnesses and some Mem-
bers of the Committee about Los Alamos National Laboratory. 

We're very proud of it in New Mexico, as well as Sandia Laborato-
ry and other such institutions. 

Gentlemen, I am privileged to meet you in person. The first 
knowledge I had ')f your experiment was in reading the local news-
paper's reprint of it. I must confess to you, that is the first skepti-
cism that was presented to me as a Member of this Committee 
back home, is that it appeared that the first release of this infor-
mation was in the form of a press release. We politicians are noto-
rious for doing that, but I was told in the scientific community 
things are done differently. But I heard you refer earlier to pre-
senting the material in a sort of abbreviated form in scientific jour-
nals. 

So I would just like to clarify, what was the first release of the 
information? Was it to a scientific journal, even in abbreviated 
form, or was it in a, if you will, commercial press release? 

Dr. PONS. The first release of the information was to the Journal 
of Electroanalytical Chemistry on March the 11th, 1989. 

Mr. SCHIFF. Thank you. 


Gentlemen, since—if I understood correctly—your experiment 

produced heat but not at least the expected number of neutrons as 
a by-product, may I ask how you conclude that you have witnessed 
fusion and not a chemical reaction that produced the heat? 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Congressman, the point, really, which demon-
strates this is that you have heat release of the order of 10 watts 
per cubic centimeter of electrode material for periods of the order 
of 100 hours. We have actually run experiments longer than that. 

In that time, you typically release what is quantified as 5 mega-
joules of energy per cubic centimeter, which is about a factor of a 
hundred larger than that for any conceivable chemical reaction in 
the system. I have no doubt that if we ran it for a thousand 
hours—but now we come into a cost problem here, because you 
now are trying to run these experiments for a longer time—I have 
no doubt that if you run these things for a thousand hours, we will 
have 50 megajoules per cubic centimeter. So it would be a factor of 
a thousand times higher in that chemical process. 

I have seen the calculations which people have put forward to 
try to explain that we would have a chemical phenomenon. They 
just don't hold up. We shall reply to that in other publications. 

That is just not possible. We have a moment of the chemical phe- 
nornena in our system which might possibly affect our results, and 
they are of a very, very minor scale and can't explain the results 
which we have observed. 

Mr. SCHIFF. In other words, Dr. Fleischmann, you're saying the 
amount of heat produced in your experiment was greater than 
could be explained through a chemical reaction? 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Absolutely. 

Mr. SCHIFF. In terms of heat, in another study I have done as a 
member of the Energy Research Subcommittee of this Committee, 
the existence of heat to produce a fusion reaction has been almost 
axiomatic, at least in the testimony I've heard. In your opinion, 
gentlemen, what is there in your cold fusion experiment that sub-
stitutes for heat? In other words, the existing facilities produce 
heat to try to gain fusion; yours does not. So how do you circum-
vent that to get the results of fusion? 

Dr. Pox& The critical parameter is to attain this minimum con-
fmement time, which physicists have stated is 10 to the 3—is well 
known as 3 times 10 to the 14th. This was one of the axis on one of 
our diagrams. Our confinement parameter is 10 to the 36th. So this 
also is a critical parameter. 

Additionally, it is also well known that fusion reactions can 
easily take place at room temperature—indeed, much lower than 
room temperature. This has been demonstrated by muon catalyzed 
fusion. So there are other things that must occur and can substi-
tute for high temperature. One of those is holding these nuclei 
close enough for long enough, and you attain that with a confine-
ment parameter. Essentially, in muon catalyzed fusion, you attain 
a very high confinement parameter as well. 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. May I just back that and say our original hy-
pothesis, which we still adhere to, to some extent, is that you 
would get clusters of neutrons in the lattice—in appropriate lattice 
spaces. It is those clusters of neutrons with associated change in 
the screening of repulsion between the neutrons which would allow 
significant fusion events to take place. 

Its a hypothesis. I think it would be a very difficult task to prove 
this theoretically. You could qualitatively prove this theoretically, 
but it is a difficult task. But that was our working hypothesis, and 
I think it's, in the end, we believe it is so because we have observed 
the fusion phenomenon. 

Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask one more question 
with your permission. 

The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman is recognized. 

Mr. SCHIFF. Thank you. 

Gentlemen, the Energy, Research and Development Subcommit-
tee has authorized a great amount of funding for fusion research, 
not only because of scientific achievement but because, as you have 
heard discussed here, the goal of energy—clean, cheap energy in 
the future that we know were going to need. 

Do you have any opinion at this time that you would like to offer 
in terms of looking at an ultimate commercialization, a power 
plant, if you will, to generate electricity for cities? Would you offer 
any comparison of cold fusion that you have experimented with 
with high temperature fusion, in terms of which might be the more 
commercially practical means in the future? 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. That is one of those sort of bottom line ques-
tions you are posing me, Congressman. I think it will be apparent 
to you that the design we are working on is related to something 
which could be put into practice using existing technology, without 
too much modification, using existing technology, nuclear technolo-
gY. Now, if we are correct, that we can make a range of devices 
scaled to different dimensions, then one point I think which this 
would raise very early on is the decentralized generation of electric 
power. That would be desirable in a developed economy, but even 
more desirable in a third world economy, because, of course, their 
costs of distributing power are the major part of the whole oper-
ation. 

Now, I view the existing efforts in fusion research as being orien-
tated at the large scale generation of power. It might be that this 
approach would be suitable for that, it might not. So one's initial 
task would be to assess the relative needs of the large scale genera-
tion of power in centralized facilities versus the decentralized gen-
eration and consumption of power in local facilities. We are not 
competent to make such an assessment, and this would be a study I 
think which the Committee would wish to have initiated by people 
who are competent in techno-economics. 

Mr. SCHIFF. Thank you, gentlemen. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Connecticut, Mr. Shays. 

Mr. SHAYS. Thank you. 

I would like to thank you both for being here. I have to say that 
I'm a new Member and I am extraordinarily excited to be on this 
Committee and to hear your presentation and to hear my col-
leagues ask their questions and your responses. 

If your discovery is verified, what you have done is obviously 
changed the course of mankind. I would just like to parenthetically 
ask you, there must have been a moment when, my god, you said 
"We may have changed the course of mankind." Did that happen? 

Was there a moment like that? 

Dr. PONS. No. 
[Laughter.] 
It sure changed our lives, I'll tell you that. 

Mr. SHAYS. Let me just say to you that you don't have the advan-
tage I do. I see a lot of smiling faces behind you, and some of your 
responses. 

I know you've talked in general terms. I'm not a scientist. I 
think I'm like many Americans. I had no science class in high 
school and only one in college, so that's the kind of person you've 
having to communicate with. But my understanding is we're talk-
ing about cheaper energy, we're talking, in essence, about unlimit-
ed energy, and energy that may be less destabilizing to our envi-
ronment; is that accurate? 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. That is accurate, Congressman, yes. 

Mr. SHAYS. You touched—and we can imagine the positive con-
tribution this can make. What potentially are the negative, not the 
destabilizing, but what potentially can be—does this have use in 
terms of weaponry that could be very regretful? 

Dr. PONS. We have not considered any weapons applications 
whatsoever. I imagine there could be social problems as a new tech-
nology begins, but we have not considered any. 

Mr. SHAYS. We are told by some of the experts that come before 
this Committee that we are a science-creating machine in our coun-
try, but we're not a science-consuming machine. I couldn't help but 
wonder with that. 

Are you aware of any attempts by the Europeans or the Japa-
nese scientists to develop viable cold fusion? 

Dr. FLEISCHIVLANN. Congressman, I think the people who speak 
after us are more able to put you in the picture about that, but it is 
certainly true that this is being researched around the world, and 
I've had confirmation of our results from far afield, very far afield. 

You can guess where that might be. 

Mr. SHAYS. Obviously, one of our interests, as has been pointed 
out by the distinguished woman Chairman of the Energy Subcom-
mittee, that we're interested in large measure with the commercial 
aspects. But our Committee gets involved with the funding of so 
much research. Are you going to be—and obviously, we want it 
spent well, and we want to make sure we're putting it in the right 
areas. 

Are you going to be making recommendations, specific recom-
mendations, on what Government policy should flow as a result of 
your work, or will there be someone who follows that will do that? 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Congressman, that will be presented by Chase 
Peterson, the President of our University. 

Mr. SHAYS. Okay. 

I would just like to thank you and this Committee for having this 
hearing. Thank you. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank the distinguished gentleman. 

The gentleman from California has another question. 

Mr. PACKARD. I do, Mr. Chairman. This is, I think, prime two 
witnesses and I hate to lose them without this question. 

What is the difference between fusion of using what we call 
"heavy" water versus "light" water, and are there similar possibili-
ties with light water? 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. That's another bottom line question. As some-
one once said to me, "you're not standing on my toes; you're stand-
ing on my feet." I think we would prefer not to—there are certain-
ly possibilities of carrying out fusion reactions involving light 
water, or mixtures of light and heavy water. But we really do not 
wish to be drawn into this particular discussion at this time, Con-
gressman. 

Mr. PACKARD. Thank you. 

The CHAIRMAN. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Ranking 
Member, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Walker. 

Mr. WALKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

I'm sorry I wasn't here for all of your testimony, but I gather the 
one question we probably need to ask at this point of you, and then 
probably of witnesses to follow, is what should this Committee be 
doing at this point to help you? 

Dr. Porrs. I think to hear the rest of the testimony and then 
make a decision on whether the establishment of a center or the 
establishment of ongoing research should be made. As far as per- 
sonally, I think we are going to continue with our research, irre-
gardless. 


i 

Mr. WALKER. But the question for this Committee is whether or 
not we want to go ahead, use the base of research that you have 
now provided to establish a center, to take a look at this, and then 
look at applications and all of that. I mean, that's where you see 
this process going and where this Committee could be most help-
ful? 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Yes, Congressman. What we are looking to is 
the resources to widen the science base and the theory base, and to 
try to short-circuit the consecutive development of this project and 
to attempt, for once, to initiate a parallel technological develop-
ment at an early stage. That is really the substance of what we are 
looking to the Committee for. 

Mr. WALKER. You mentioned a couple of minutes ago the fact 
that if you could run the experiment for a thousand hours it would 
give you more proof and so on, that you would say that gets into 
the question of cost. If we, for instance, were able to allocate $25 
million out of this Committee for your work, would that allow you 
to do that kind of experiment? 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Surely, Congressman. I mean, the point about 
running a long-term experiment is—I don't know what the, policy is 
here, whether you run a two-shift system and thus the verification, 
or a three-shift system. You do have to triplicate on the staff, on 
the staffing, you have to put the resources in, you have to monitor. 

The first question which any industrial organization will ask is 
what is your thousand hour performance and what is your 7,000 
hour performance? What is your one-year performance, your half-
year performance? 

Now, that requires funding. That is absolutely—that is beyond a 
private person's capability, and it is totally beyond the normal 
funding level which can be secured in the university or even from 
the conventional science-funding organizations in any country. 

That needs a special initiative. 

Mr. WALKER. But as has been mentioned here, this Committee in 
the past has been willing to put fairly large amounts of money into 
fusion research, because we think that it's extremely important for 
the Nation's future to move in that direction. 

The question is, we want to make certain at this point, that if 
this is an exciting new opportunity, as we believe it to be, are we 
willing then to give you sufficient resources. I am trying to get 
some idea of what you would regard as sufficient resources to 
assure that each of the goals that you want to attain gets done. 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Congressman, I really do think that the presi-
dent of our university is more capable of giving you that figure. 

Mr. WALKER. That's what I understand, and so my main ques-


tion— 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. But it is—we are talking about units of tens of 
millions of dollars. That is quite clear. 

Mr. WALKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. Let me ask just one. We've been dancing around 
that maypole, and I know the next two panels are going to get into 
that issue. 

I think the question that ought to go on the record, at least as 
far as these two distinguished scientists are concerned, and at this 
point, do you feel that your work is of credibility and of substance 
enough—and that's the purpose of this hearing, fundamentally, 
today—to continue intensive research in the field of cold fusion? I 
think basically that is the question. 

And then it would seem to me that a logical follow-on question 
would be, as Dr. Fleischmann was pointing out, that to get the opti-
mum yield or the time of getting the yield out of the process could 
run somewhere from 10 to 20 years. 

Now, assuming those two premises are correct, which we accept 
in your presentation this morning, we either limp along, I would 
assume, with limited resources to make our experimentation, 
which exacerbates the time frame—time is a combination of time 
and money for me, and time and space—or we say we make a rea-
sonable, whatever that is, kind of contribution, some kind of help, 
jointly, severally, whatever the case may be, to shorten as much as 
possible, within reason, the time for additional experimentation, 
for peer review, and for all the other—what do you call it, scien-
tists and folks doing this kind of research throughout the world. 

Isn't that reasonably where we're at at this point so far? 

Dr. PONS. Yes, I think that's precisely the question. I think that 
if, indeed, it works, there will be other efforts elsewhere in the 
world to do the same thing, and maybe with a different philosophy 
than we normally do. 

The CHAIRMAN. If the gentleman can yield, but my father taught 
me something in my life which I've never forgotten. He said to me, 
"Remember one thing, that half of nothing is nothing." So the 
question is the degree and the credibility and the desire for the 
Nation to move ahead, basically. Isn't that correct? 


Dr. PONS. That's— 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Chairman, may I just add to that. I think 
I may have expressed it to other Members of the Committee yester-
day, and I would like to reiterate that. In a society with high inter-
est rates and inflationary pressure, it is essential to shorten the 
commercialization of any new idea. That is a high risk strategy and 
we must be willing to say, if it doesn't work, oops, curtail it. Cut it 
off. But I think the worst scenario for the development of a new 
idea is to believe that we can continue with the sequential develop-
ment of the science and technology. We must move towards the si-
multaneous development of science and technology in this area, as 
indeed in every other area of endeavor. 

The CHAIRMAN. You see, if the Committee will indulge me one 
more moment, because this is sort of a little bit of a summary 
before you folks finish, there is another huge issue involved that 
has not been touched upon, in my judgment, because of the enthu-
siasm and the genuine excitement of what we are looking at today. 

But it seems to be very axiomatic to me when we start talking 
about the battle of the budget—and my good friend, Bob Walker, 
and I will have to be testifying—not testifying—we will be fighting 
on the floor today to protect the Science, Space, and Technology re-
search programming. We've got to come back and say to the Con-
gress and to the American people that if you don't develop a less 
offensive, call it that, or less waste product type of energy source, 
that you are exacerbating a whole series of issues, such as the 
ozone situation, and on and on. I'm thinking about the acid rain 
and whatever. 

So that maybe when people would start to think a minute, that if 
we can get into the new technologies that begin to show promising 
results, as you testified to here today, that that can help us, where 
billions of dollars are involved and resources to solve these other 
problems—in fact, even the destruction of mankind, I don't think 
that's too dramatic to say today. So I think that we have to put 
into perspective, it isn't just the idea of clean, inexpensive energy; 
what does it mean to mankind and the people. That's what the av-
erage citizen has to understand. I think you have done the job and 
we hope to be able to draw that out a little bit further. 

I see the gentleman from California wishes to make a further 
comment. 

Mr. BROWN. The Chairman has been emphasizing some points 
that I wanted to make, and you have done it very well, and I won't 
belabor it, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. All right. Are there any further questions or 
comments from the distinguished Members of the Committee? The 
gentleman from New York? 

We want to thank you very much for your time and your presen-
tation. We think it's been excellent. There's a lot of work to do and 
we'll get on with it and decide what we're going to do from here. 

Dr. PoNs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much.

Dear Congresswoman Lloyd, 
First may I tell you that I am disconcerted in not knowing the 
correct way in which to address you. I believe I made a faux pas in 
addressing you at our meeting in Washington. 

Secondly, I must apologise for being as tardy in replying to 
your letter of the 4th May and you will see that I am at present in 
Southampton. �It proved quite impossible for me to deal with my 
correspondence while I was visiting Salt Lake City recently and I do 
hope that my late reply will not cause you too many difficulties. �I 
am addressing my replies to Kathryn Holmes and I trust that she will 
forward this letter to you. 

Professor Pons and I certainly appreciated being able to meet 
the members of the Committee and to outline the work which we have 
been doing. May I tell you that our current research fully confirms 
our earlier findings and that we look forward to publishing full 
accounts of our work during the Summer. Stan Pons and I have also 
found the sociological aspects of the recent controversy most inter-
esting - I think it will prove to be the first example of scientific 
hysteria induced by electronamail and Fax machines. We both feel 
that there might well have to be new laws of libel with regard to 
publications in such media. 

With kind regards, 
Yours sincerely, 
Wtt ffethizaa,..

6 June 1989 

Dear Ms. Holmes, 
I am sure you will recall that Mrs Lloyd addressed three 
questions to me following our meeting in Washington and she has asked 
me to send my replies to you. May I ask you to hand the enclosed 
letter to her. �In that letter I have apologised for being so late 
with my reply: it proved quite impossible for me to deal with my 
correspondence during my recent visit to Salt Lake City and I can only 
hope that the delay will not have caused you any difficulties. 


Question 1  

In our own work we have made numerous "blank" determinations. 

At this stage I can only tell you those that were concerned with heavy 
water. Thus for example there is no generation of excess heat when 
using platinum cathodes or when using inactive palladium cathodes. 

As I have implied I am not able at this stage to comment about 
work in ordinary water but I will certainly follow up this letter when 
I am able to do so. It is, however, well known that others have 
shown that there Is no generation of excess heat when using light 
water. 

As I have only now returned to the U.K., I have had no 
opportunity to review the work with my colleagues in Harwell. 

However, again to the best of my knowledge, nobody has observed any 
neutrons or gamma rays above background when making measurements in 
ordinary water. 

Our own experiments on the detection of gamma rays and neutrons 
have been carried out almost exclusively to check on the safety of our 
observations. We have only observed such radiation from the largest 
electrodes which we have used when these were polarised at the highest 
current densities and when these electrodes were generating large 
excesses of heat (using heavy water). In this work we have used a 
Harwell Neutron Dose Equivalent Rate Monitor, Type 95/0949-5 and a 
Nuclear Data ND-6 High Energy Spectrum Analyser. 

It is important to realise that neutrons are produced in bursts 
and it appears to us that tritium production also takes place 
discontinuously. 


/continued � 

OV 

Question 2  

Our main experiments concerning the production of tritium have 
dealt with comparison of the generation on platinum and palladium 
electrodes in heavy water. There is a very small increase in the 
background level when using platinum and a very much larger increase 
when using palladium. The results which we have reported showed an 
increase of about 10-20 disintegrations per minute Wpm) for a 1 ml 
sample taken from a cell containing a Pt electrode, the initial 
concentration being 41 dpm. The steady state concentration fora Pd 
electrode of the same size was 141 dpm. The current density was 64 
mA cm-2  and the total current was 200 mA. These tritium levels are 
low compared to the observations which have been made by other 
research workers. 

To the best of my knowledge comparisons have not yet been done 
on the accumulation of tritium in heavy and light water and this is a 
blank determination which must certainly be put in hand. 

The quantification of the production of helium is extremely 
difficult and Professor Pons and I would not wish to commit ourselves 
on this topic at this time. �Indeed, we are presently arranging for a 
blind test to be carried out which will involve a variety of samples 
as well as a number of laboratories who have offered to help with the 
mass spectrometric analyses. 


Question 3 

This can be ruled out completely and we do, in fact, have a 
video which demonstrates the extremely rapid radial mixing in our 
cells, as well as the somewhat slower axial mixing. �As heat is 
injected along the axis, the latter is not important and we have, in 
fact, confirmed that there are no temperature gradients in our cells 
under the conditions which we use. �In our system there is vigorous 
gas evolution and at low current densities we additionally bubble 
gas through the cell. 

I believe I understand the origin of this question: at least 
one vocal commentator on our work copied the cell design which we 
demonstrated at the Committee meeting. We have not as yet used cells 
of this size which have been designed for work with very large 
electrodes. As they are the largest cells we have made, we thought 
it most convenient to use these as a visual aid. However, it turns 
out that others have used electrodes smaller than our smallest 
electrodes in cells of such enormous size and have been polarised at 
the currents which are lower than our lowest currents. �It is totally 
unsurprising, therefore, that these workers have observed temperature 
gradients in their cells. 

Yours sincerely, 


Martin Fleischmann

The CHAIRMAN. Our second panel for today is Dr. Chase Peter. 
son, President of the University of Utah, accompanied by Mr. Ira 
Magaziner—is that the correct pronunciation? Pretty good, wasn't 
it? Magaziner, from Rhode Island. 

The Committee will come to order. The Chair recognizes the dis-
tinguished—We'll wait just a minute, Dr. Peterson, until our 
guests... 

The Chair wishes to acknowledge and welcome our distinguished 
Dr. Chase Peterson, President of the University of Utah, and his 
colleague, Mr. Magaziner. And, Mr. Owens, did you wish to com-
ment again? 

Mr. OWENS. I would only give this very brief background, Mr. 

Chairman. Dr. Peterson is an eminent physician and scholar and a 
former Vice President at Harvard University, and has been for six 
years President of the University of Utah. 

He will be followed by Ira . Magaziner, who is one of the world's 
renowned business consultants, particularly dealing on issues of 
competition, world competition. He has written several books, in-
cluding "The Silent War", which it will be my pleasure to provide 
a copy of to each Member of the Committee. 

The CHAIRMAN. The Chair wants to recognize Dr. Peterson. 

STATEMENT OF DR. CHASE N. PETERSON, M.D., PRESIDENT, 


UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH 

Dr. PETERSON. Chairman Roe, Members of the Committee—
The CHAIRMAN. You have to move that microphone closer. 

Dr. PETERSON. Chairman Roe—Is that better? 

The CHAIRMAN. Yes, that's much better. 

Dr. PETERSON. —and Members of the Committee. 

The CHAIRMAN. If you could just suspend a minute, Doctor. 

In or out, ladies and gentlemen, one or the other. Close the 
doors. 

You're recognized. 

Dr. PETERSON. Fine. 

It's an honor to be with you. With your permission, I would 
submit my written testimony for the record and speak very briefly 
from notes. 

The CHAIRMAN. No objection. So ordered. 


Dr. PETERSON. Congressman/Professor Ritter, I've learned of 

your background in the last few minutes. Let me comment on the 
question you asked of our investigators—why didn't they come to 
other sources for money. I asked the same question myself four 
months ago, and Professor Pons said "I have my pride. I would 
have been too embarrassed to ask my university to fund something 
that was as far-fetched as this." Well, I think it does say something 
about the individual you were talking about. 

Mr. RITTER. If the gentleman would yield, it also says something 
that perhaps we need to encourage greater flexibility in our own 
procedures in dealing with scientists. 

The CHAIRMAN. I also want to add a comment, Dr. Peterson, that

Dr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I perceive the caution in your 
remark to this former professor. 

The comments that my colleague, Ira Magaziner, has to make 
about what essentially is a separate but related issue, and that is 
the public policy aspects of this, in my view, they are so important 
that I would like to turn to him and have him give his testimony 
right now, and I will stand with him to pick up my own testimony, 
if there are pieces that would usefully contribute later. If that's all 
right with you, Mr. Chairman, I would turn— 
The CHAIRMAN. No objection whatsoever. The Chair recognizes 
the distinguished gentleman, Mr. Magaziner, from Rhode Island. 

STATEMENT OF IRA C MAGAZINER, CONSULTANT TO THE 
UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, PRESIDENT, TELESIS, USA, INC. 

Mr. MAGAZINER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 

I'm not from Utah and I wouldn't recognize a piece of palladium 
or a fusion reaction even if I were staring right at it. In that 
regard, I assume I'm similar to most people in this room. 

What I am concerned about—and it's a somewhat different issue 
than what we've been talking about—is what is American public 
policy going to be with respect to this invention and, in general, 
with respect to inventions that we make in this country. 

From its early days, this Nation prospered in great measure be-
cause we were very good at taking science and being very practical 
in converting it into industry. Over the past 15 years, we have been 
losing that ability. I can go through a whole long list for you, and 
I'll give you part of it. 

American scientists at Raytheon invented the microwave oven, 
but today it is Korean and Japanese companies who produce 90 
percent of the world's microwave ovens. American scientists at 
RCA invented the color television, but today European and East 
Asian companies produce over 97 percent of the world's color tele-
visions. American scientists at Ampex invented the VCR, but today 
Japanese, Korean, and European companies produce over 99 per-
cent of world VCRs. American scientists, funded by DARPA, in-
vented the computer numerically controlled machine tool, but 
today European and Japanese companies produce over 75 percent 
of the world's computer numerically controlled machine tools. 

American scientists at AT&T Bell Labs and Texas Instruments 
invented the base technology that produced the world's first 
memory chip, but today over 80 percent of the memory chips pro-
duced in the world are produced in Japan. American scientists, 
backed by NASA, sent the first commercial communications satel-
lites into space, but today, it is a European Company, Aerienne 
Espace, which has acquired well over half of the commercial space 
launching business. 

American scientists at Control Data and Cray Corporation in-
vented and perfected the first supercomputer, and we now trail, 
technologically, Japan's NEC in the production of supercomputers. 

American scientists at Bell Labs invented the first photovoltaic 
cell, and we're now seeing the Japanese and European companies 
produce over 70 percent of the world's photovoltaic cells. And more 
recently, three years ago, we made the breakthrough in supercon- 
ductors, and a recent OTA report now assesses that the Japanese 
are ahead in commercializing superconductors. 

I'm afraid I could go on with this list for a long time. I won't do 
it today. But we all know the result of it is, the result is that we 
still have a $135 billion negative trade balance despite devaluing 
our dollar by 48 percent the past couple of years. We should make 
no mistake about it. Over 50 percent of our negative trade balance 
is from countries who pay higher wages and higher benefits to 
their workers than we do. They don't beat us with cheap labor. 

They beat us with technology and skilled labor. 

That is the fundamental reason why I have come today, to talk a 
little bit about why we're not being able to commercialize and reap 
the economic benefits of our scientific invention. 

In former days, as Dr. Fleischmann said, we had a kind of chain 
of events that took many decades from basic research to getting 
products. Basic research was done in the universities, then compa-
ny or Government laboratory scientists read the papers, produced 
and began to think about new technologies. Then company product 
divisions began to engineer specific product prototypes to take to 
their customers. Then the customers looked them over and suggest-
ed modifications. Then these products were introduced to the 
market. Then companies worked on ways to manufacture these 
new products more efficiently. It was all done sequentially, it all 
took decades. 

Today, these steps don't move sequentially. They move in paral-
lel. Even before basic science is proven, applied research begins, 
product developments are undertaken, market research is done, 
and manufacturing processes are working. That's the way the Jap-
anese and Europeans are playing the game. We in America are not 
playing it that way. 

In this country, usually we have companies competing with each 
other in these basic stages, whereas in Europe and Japan there are 
major programs of government-backed cooperation, not just for the 
basic research but also for the commercialization, the commercial 
research and development. 

In Japan, billions are being spent through the agency for science, 
industrial science and technology, located within MITI, to fund a 
whole series of projects, about 50 different projects. The areas of 
emphasis range across the scientific spectrum. 

In Europe, billions of dollars are being spent through programs 
called Eureka, Esprit, Brite and Race, dedicated to commercializing 
basic science. 

As we speak now, in Japan there are now a number of company 
laboratories, as well as university laboratories, working in this cold 
fusion area. Beginning about a week after these experiments were 
announced, these were set up. And people at MITI are now formu-
lating a plan for a joint government-industry-university task force, 
as they do in Japan, to look not just into expanding the basic sci-
ence, but into commercializing, commercializing activities from this 
basic science. 

What is called a "fusion fever" in the Japanese newspaper has 
gripped Japan's scientific and commercial communities, and as far 
as we can tell, there are over a hundred companies already begin-
ning to think about ways that this can proceed. 

Similarly, a project team is being formed at Eureka in Europe to 
do the same thing, not just fund the basic science but also look to-
wards commercial research and development in the field. 

Now, what should we do to respond to this? Well, if we do what 
we did with high temperature superconductivity, we will work for 
a- while to verify and test the science; then the Defense Department 
will sponsor some work on how it could be useful to them; a hand-
ful of our companies will each put a few people to work on it; some 
Utah bodies, assisted perhaps by State and Federal funds, will sup-
port the continuation on . a modest level of research, and maybe 
even develop a national laboratory of some sort. Then what will 
happen is OTA will undertake an 18-month study, which will be 
completed in early 1991, and will report that the Japanese have 
blown past us again in commercialization of another new science. 

There is an alternative, and that's what I would like to talk to 
you about today in the remaining few minutes. It's an alternative 
that says that America is prepared to fight to win this time. The 
alternative is to form a research institute around this new science, 
but one which will be adequately funded and flexibly run, and 
which will engage both in basic research and, very importantly, in 
commercial development work. The institute can be funded with 
money from universities, the State, corporations, and some from 
the Federal Government. Additional funds can be made available 
to fund on a matching basis corporate efforts to develop products, 


manufacturing processes, prototypes, and market demonstration 

projects. 

While Federal grants can be used to fund the basic research, we 
would suggest that the assistance for applied research and commer-
cialization can be provided in the form of conditionally reimbursa-
ble loans so that the taxpayers can realize some return as well 
from the commercialization of this new science. 

The University of Utah is willing to raise the money from its 
supporters, and has already started to do so, and from private cor-
porations to support the effort. The State of Utah has already com-
mitted five million dollars to support the effort, and now it's the 
Federal Government's turn to step up to the plate. This need not 
be, nor is it desirable, for it to be primarily a Federal Government 
based project. But to match the competition in Europe and Japan, 
there must be Federal support. 

But wait a second, you say. The science isn't even proven. Repu-
table fusion physicists throughout the world are expressing pro-
found skepticism about the experiments. We don't even know 
whether its really fusion for sure, although I would say fairly con-
vincing arguments have been made to say that it is, and to some 
extent, if we go charging ahead, as I'm suggesting, we could all 
wind up with egg on our face, because we will have this major 
effort getting going—and then suppose it turns out to be a dirty 
test tube? I'm sure it's not, but suppose it does. 

Well, like most of you, I'm not a scientist. I can't comment on 
whether this is the most important invention of the century or 
whether it's nothing ultimately. What I do know is that some very 
serious and accomplished people think it's real, and I do know that 
if it is, the implications are dramatic for the world and in particu-
lar for the nation that pioneers the products based on it. 

I am a business strategy consultant, and if you will indulge me 
for a second, I'll take you through a risk/return analysis to our two 
alternatives here. One alternative says we proceed as I've suggest-
ed and begin to fund the development of this center at Utah, and 
what begins to happen is that maybe a week from now or a month 
from now or a year from now somebody discovers that this was all 
wrong. If it's a week from now, we may wind up losing thousands; 
if it's a month from now, we may wind up losing hundreds of thou-
sands; if it's a year from now, we may end up losing a couple of 
million. All that's not anything to laugh about. It's a lot of money. 

A lot of good public servants have gotten in trouble for losing track 
of lesser amounts of money. 

But now let's suppose that the science is real and it does open up 
a new energy source in the next decade and becomes a multi-billion 
dollar or even hundred billion dollar industry in the next few dec-
ades. If we dawdle and wait until the science is proven, and if we 
wait for economists to hold symposia on whether Adam Smith 
would approve of putting public money into it, or if we more cau-
tiously and invest only in basic research, or only in defense appli-
cations, and wait for the spinoff, we're going to be much slower off 
the blocks than our Japanese and European competitors, because 
they won't run the race that way. Whether we approve of the way 
they do it or not, that's what they do, and they move quickly to 
commercialize. 

Competitive success is a leading position in a race. If we fall too 
far behind at the beginning, we may never catch up. The downside 
risk of that could well be hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs 
for our children, billions of dollars of trade balance, and billions in 
wealth, which then will go to someone else. Ultimately, it's not a 
very hard business strategy question. The downside of not doing 
something is much greater than the downside of taking the risk of 
spending some money. 

So now I hope you can understand why I came here, even though 
I'm not from Utah. I have an interest in America's future. I see 
this as an opportunity both for America to develop this science and 
to future American prosperity, and also, importantly, to develop a 
model for how America can regain world preeminence in commer-
cializing other new sciences in the coming decade. 

I have come here to ask you to prevent another TV or VCR or 
computerized machine tool or solar cell or superconductor story. I 
have come to ask you to lead so that we will not be the first in our 
Nation's ten generations to leave its children a country less pros-
perous than the one we inherited. I have come here to ask you for 
the sake of my children and all of America's next generation to 
have America do it right this time. 

Thank you very much.

HOUSE COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, SPACE, AND TECHNOLOGY 

APRIL 26, 1989 

TWTCRIc 

Dr. Pox& Oh, no. The State has taken out a number of patents 
on the process, and the entire research effort. 

Mr. RITTER. My time is up. I want to commend you, I want to 
commend the University, and I want to commend the great State 
of Utah for being first. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank the distinguished gentleman. 

The Chair recognizes the distinguished gentleman from Califor-
nia, Mr. Rohrabacher. 

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I didn't know I 
was going to be next. 

First of all, congratulations to both of you for maintaining your 
composure at what must be a tumultuous time in both of your 
lives, especially in front of a hearing like this. Sometimes it gets a 
little difficult to express yourselves, and you've done very well 
today and I appreciate it I'm sure the rest of us appreciate it as 
well. 

First of all, we just heard a question about Stanford University. 

Have the findings from Stanford University tended to verify your 
findings? 

Dr. Pox& The experiments were quite similar. I have not yet 
seen all the experimental details, but yes, I think that could be 
considered a pretty—Yes. I think there will be testimony on that, 
as a matter of fact, later today. 

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay. 

Your support for existing programs notwithstanding, we all 
know that you've created a lot of heat, not only in the beaker but 
outside the beaker as #'well. Do you think that some of this heat is 
being generated by the fact that there are a lot of people in the 
scientific community who are dependent on hundreds and millions 
of dollars worth of Government grants that may not be open 
minded towards the type of change you're suggesting is possible? 

Dr. PoNs. The only comment I would make there is that I think 
it's always dangerous to point at incorrect experimental data being 
based on theory. I think theory must be used to explain experimen-
tal data, not to criticize experimental data. I mean, if it's a well-
established theory, then certainly you can raise questions. But I 
think that you need to consider first that the experimental data 
must be duplicated and explained, and then a theory put forth, 
rather than just saying your data must be wrong because the 
theory doesn't predict that. 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. I think Professor Pons is alluding to the 
nature of the criticism which has been leveled by people who are 
working in those areas of research. I don't really see that our work 
impacts too much on that work. It's another line to pursue and 
should be seen as that. 

Mr. ROHRABACHER. But you're going to put some of these people 
out of business, aren't you, if you're successful? 

Dr. FLEISCHMANN. Well, no. I think we will put them out of—if 
we are successful in demonstrating the science space, and if we go 
to the point of technology, then the Members of this Committee 
and the scientific community at large will start to make a choice 
about whether to develop this technology. But that technology has 
to be developed not only in competition with fusion, other fusion

Over the past fifteen yeers, howeVer, we have

I am afraid that I could keep us hare for

list is growing faster than the positive one. 
,.. �What's the result of all this? A negative 
trade balance of $135 billion despite a 484 
devaluation of the dollar over the past 4 years. This 
deficit forces. us to borrow from our foreign 
competitors each year and to sell them our land, our 
buildings and even our productive companies to finance 
our current living standards. And let's be clear. 

Well over 504 of this trade deficit is with nations 
like: Japan, Germany, France, Sweden, Holland, 
switierland and Denmark who pay higher wages -- yes 
higher wages -- and higher benefits to their workers 
than we do to ours. They don't beat us with cheep 
labor, they beat us with technology and skilled labor. 


APR 25 '89 IO:II �FROM TELESIS 

PAGE.005 

There are many reasons for our negative trade 
balance, but the fact that foreign countries are able 


to convert science into commercial products quicker 

and better than we do is one of the crucial causes. 

The reasons they can do this are not hard to 


understands more investment, better cooperation among 

government, industry, universities and research 

institutes and superior planning to develop marketable 

products even before the science is proven. 

In former days, basic research was done in 


universities. Then, company or government laboratory 

scientists read the papers produced and began to think 


of new technologies. Then company product divisions 

began to engineer specific product prototypes to take 
to their customers. Then the customers looked them 


over and suggested modifications. Then these products 

were introduced to the market. Then companies worked 
on ways to manufacture these now products more 
efficiently. The proCits from basic science to mass 
production took decades. 

Today, these steps don't move sequentially, 
they move in parallel. Even before basic science is 
proven, applied research begins,


- product developments 

are undertaken, market research is done, and 

manufacturing processes are developed . . . and here 
is where we in America fall behind. 


In AmeriCa, these early steps are usually 

taken by companies working on their oen, -  competing 
with each other and often duplicating each others work 
as they compete. In Europe and Japan today c  these 
steps in what is called the precompetitive stage are 
taken in cooperation. Companies work with each other 
and with applied research institutes and universities, 


usually with government funding and support, to 

accelerate the process of turning science into 

marketable products. in America, this partnership 

approach is frowned upon as meddling with the free 
market. in Europe and Japan, it is only when the 


first generation of products is developed that 

competition is promoted -- and then companies compete 
fiercely with each other. 


APR 25 '89 10:12 �FROM TELESIS 

PRGE.00S 

Increasingly, the early stage competition is 

among nations and the later stage among companies. 


We may not philosophically approve of this 

government backing for industrial development but it 

is the reality in today's international marketplace 

and we cannot let our bias blind us to its 
effectiveness. Catching up requires many actions: 


changing our financial structure to encourage 

industrial companies to take a longer time horizon, 
for example. But no action is more fundamental than 


meeting the need for publicly supported commercial 

research and development to match the efforts now 
under:4y in Europe and Japan. 


Today in Europe, billions of dollars are 

being spent each year through general programs such as 
Eureka, Esprit, Brits, and Race and through specific 
programs like Airbus and Aerienne on over 500 projects 


bringing together companies and research institutes to 

pioneer the products of the 1990s. The Eukopeans are 


determined. over $17 billion dollars of government 

money went to finance the development of Airbus over 
20 years no that it could come from nothing to 25% of 


the world's commercial jet aircraft market, surpassing 

Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas. The result is that 
today Europe has 50,000 high skilled jobs and $5 
billion of positive trade balance instead of America. 


In Japan, billions are being spent through 

the agency for Industrial Science and Technology 

located within the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry on dozens of joint projects bringing together 


companies, government laboratories and universities to 

pioneer products for the 1990s. Areas of emphasis 


range from biotechnology to how high performance 

materials to new electronic devices. 

And what do we have to match these efforts? 

A few hundred million funnelled through the Defense 
Department for a handful of projects such as Sematech.

And even when we do these, we go through soul 
'wrenching debates about whether we are violating our 


free market principles. Recently DARPA has been 

considering awarding $30 to $60 million to fund high 
definition television development in the U.S. and the 
debate about whether this is correct policy has 
reached the Covers of a half dozen major periodicals. 

Prom Europe and Japan where hundreds of millions of 


government dollars routinely have been going into 

funding this technology every year, our late 

philosophical debate over so little money seems 

bizarre. 
• * * * * 
What does all of this have to do with my 
friends from Utah. As I speak to you now, it is 
almost midnight in Japan. At this very moment, there 
are large teams of Japanese scientists in University 


laboratories trying to verify this new tuition 

science. Even more significantly, dozens of company 

engineering labOratories are now working on 

commercializing it, thinking of products which can be 


created if thes0ience.works. Perhaps most 

signifiCantly, a half dozen MITI officials are working 
hard on a plan for a coordinated push into this new 
induetry. These efforts began within a week of the 
Utah announcement. MITI is already in the process of 
forming a committee to implement its plan. A 


phenomenon the Japanese newspapers have already dubbed 

"fusion fever" has gripped Japan's scientific ADA 

commercial communities. 

Similarly, a project team is being formed at 
the Eureka program in Europe, and a number of European 
Universities and companios are already at work to 
develop a European "cold fusion" capability. �- 
So what should we do? Well, if we do as we 


did with high teeperature superconductivity, We will 

work for a while to verify and test the science. Then 
the Defense Department will sponsor some work on how 
this could be useful to them. A handful of our 
companies will each put a few people to work in the 
area and we will hold a few conferences. Some Utah

bodies assisted perhaps by state and federal funds 
will support the continuation on a modest level of 
research in this area and may even develop a national 
laboratory to pursue the science. oTA will undertake 
an 18 month study to see how we are doing and early in 
1991 they will report that the Japanese have blown 
past us again and are leading in the race to develop 
industries from this new science. 


There is an alternative. It's an alternative 

that says that America is prepared to fight to win 
this tims. The alternative is to form a research 
institute around this new science, but one which will 
be adequately funded and flexibly run and which will 
engage both in basic research and in commercial 
development work. The institute can be funded with 
money from the university, the state, corporations and 


the federal government. Additional !un

do can be made 

available to fund on a matching basis corporate 
efforts to develop producte, manufacturing processes, 
prototypes and market demonstration projects. 

While federal grants can be made available to 


fund the basic

-research poktion of the.instituto; the 

assistance for applied research and commercialization 

can be provided in the form of conditionally 
reimbursable loans which are paid back - with a high 
interest rate if projects succeed and not paid back if 
they don't, with a sliding scale in between. This 
will allot, the taxpayers of America to receive a 
potential return on their investment. 

The University of Utah is willing to raise 


money from its supporters and from private 

corporations to support this effort and has already 
begun to do so. The Stat. of Utah is willing to raise 
money to support this effort and has already committed 
over $8 million to do so. Now it is the federal 
government's turn to step up to the plate. This need 
not be, nor is it desirable for it to be, primarily a 
federal government based project. But to match the 
competition in Europe and Japah, there must be federal 
support.

But wait a minute you say. This science

throughout the world have expressed profound 

skepticism about these experiments. We don't even

Wouldn't it be prudent to wait until we see whether 
there is really something of value here? We could all 
wind up with an extra large egg on our faces and waste 
the public's money in the process.

slower off the blocks than our Japanese and European

we may never catch up. The downside risk of that 
could well be hundreds of thousands of high paying 
jobs for our children, billions of dollars of trade 
balance and billions in wealth which then will go to 
someone else. 

This is not a very hard business strategy 
problem. The downside of wasting a few thousand or 
even a few million dollars is far less risky than the 
downside of losing this possible future industry to 


foreign competitors. The right decision is pretty 

clear. 

So now I hope you can understand why 1 came 
here today even though I am not from Utah and have no 
interest in palladium. I have an interest in 
America's future. I see this as an opportunity for 
America both to develop this science into future 
American prosperity and also to develop a model for 


how America can regain world preeminence in 

commercializing other new sciences in the coming 

decade. 

I have come here today to ask you to prevent 
another TV or VCR or computerized machine tool or 
solar cell or superconductor story. I have come to 
ask you to lead so that we will not be the first of 
our nation's ten generations to leave its children a 
country less prosperous than the one it inherited. I 
have come here to ask you, for the sake of my children 
and all of America's next generation, to have America 
do it right this time.

Dr. PETERSON. Thank you, Ira. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Mr. Magaziner. 

Dr. Peterson. 


Dr. PETERSON. If I may continue— 

The CHAIRMAN. Yes, sir. 

Dr. PETERSON. I know some science, but I'm not a scientist. My 
job is to understand the disciplines of the university and to protect 
those disciplines and support those people, so they can do the pri-
mary work, which is research and teaching. That's what your job 
is, it seems to me. You need not be scientists here, but you are 
social science protectors and supporters, and your role for the 
Nation is much like my role is for the university. 

What led to these University of Utah experiments? It may have 
been a capacity to see an old problem from a new perspective, and 
this chemistry, this electrochemistry matter as opposed to physics 
may explain some of the humor and the bite as well as the appro-
priate skepticism that has surrounded this controversy. 

Perhaps it's not by chance that it occurred at some place like 
Utah. We pride ourselves on encouraging unorthodox thinking, 
while being viewed by the world, I suspect, as a rather conservative 
place, even a socially-orthodox place. That combination of unortho-
dox encouragement of thinking in a fairly orderly society isn't the 
worst of all worlds. 

There may also be some value in isolation. America has pros-
pered and innovated at the frontier. Utah is still a frontier. As 
there are social frontiers' in New York City and in California and 
in Washington and Tennessee, the action is on the frontiers when 
we are wise enough to recognize what a frontier is. And so the fac-
ulty we attract to Utah are those faculty who value their intellec- 
tual freedom and capacity for individual entrepreneurism perhaps 
more than anything else. 

So we're dealing with two separate but related issues today. One 
is the challenging science—you've heard of that and I won't elabo-
rate any more—not yet fully proved. The second is the challenging 
political and economic policy issue that Mr. Magaziner has raised, 
the quest of American competitiveness. 

I say it in these terms. We may be obliged to build the first floor 
of commercial development, as well as the second floor of engineer-
ing development, while we're still building the basement of scientif-
ic confirmation and enlargement. 

Now, of course, if any of these phases fail, then the process stops. 

At Utah, with the University of Utah, with colleagues from Utah 
State University and Brigham Young University, and faculty gath-
ered worldwide, that's a good place for rapid and perhaps novel de-
velopment. Our political and social system is remarkably flexible, 
in some ways a throwback again to the frontier, where we attract 
those faculty who do value their freedom. And there may be some 
value in isolation from traditional centers, quite frankly. The phys-
ical environment itself promotes vigorous thinking and vigorous 
living. 

Incidentally, we have uninhabitable, remote regions only 25 min-
utes from the University, and 25 minutes from an international 
airport, which would serve as a useful place for what you might 
call special experiments. The University, as Mr. Magaziner has 
said—the State, rather, has appropriated $5 million last week. We 
have raised $1.1 million of private funds already, and we can raise 
much more in that respect. And what we offer you is a willingness 
on our part to build a novel consortium for this purpose, perhaps a 
consortium that would work for other scientific ideas that come 
across your view, a novel consortium of Federal, State, corporate 
and university resources. Without Federal participation, the race 
would be handicapped, but I wouldn't even suggest that the Feder-
al participation is the major participation, but both symbolically 
and with the value of the money involved, we suggest that this con-
sortium—Federal, State, private corporations, and university re-
sources—may, in fact, be the best way to build this first floor of 
engineering development, a second floor of commercial develop-
ment, while we, in fact, are building a basement foundation of sci-
entific confirmation and expansion. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
[The prepared statement of Chase Peterson follows:] 


Statement of 

Dr. Chase N. Peterson 

Before the 

House Committee on Science, Space and Technology 

Hearing on Recent Developments in Solid State Fusion Research 


April 26, 1989 

My name is Chase Peterson. I am trained as a medical 
doctor. I practiced and taught for five years after residency 
and fellowship in Internal Medicine and Metabolism, and for the 
last 22 years have been in educational administration, the last 5 
1/2 of whiCh have been as president of the University of Utah. 


I know some science

, but am not a scientist. My job is to 
have some understanding for the multiple disciplines of a 
university and to provide protection and support for those who do 
the primary work of teaching and research. Perhaps then, my role 
in leading off in these hearings is to sketch a general context 
of the science under discussion, to suggest its potential 
importance for humanity and the planet, and to share with this 
important Committee of the Congress the intellectual and cultural 
Circumstances at Utah that may have played a role in its nurture 
and expression. 

Fission  involves the splitting of large atoms into smaller 
pieces and produces enormous energy. 


Fusion  involves the union 

of very small atoms into slightly larger atoms and produces even 
more energy. In each case the products of the reaction, be it 
fission or fusion, have a smaller mass than the originating atom 
-t- 
or atoms and the difference is expressed as energy in keeping 
with Einstein's formula, Energy = Mass times the Speed of Light 
sqUared,.E = mc2. =Wan occurs spontaneously in the sun in 
association with enormous heat (Millions of degrees) and 
pressure. gission  fired the first atomic bombs and provides the 
heat of atomic reactors. 


Fission  has certain disadvantages as a 

heat source. It's products are intensively radioactive and long-
'lived, giving us a nuclear waste problem. It's fuel is uranium, 
a moderately expensive and limited resource. The fuel of fission 
is contained within an atomic reactor and must be slowed and 
cooled to be safe. If an accident were to occur, as it did at 
Chernobyl, the fuel cannot easily be extracted leading to the 
possibility of runaway heat, melt-down and explosion. For 
practical fusion reactions to be recreated on earth it had been 
assumed to require temperatures approximating the heat of the 
sun. That is difficult to achieve and has challenged 
investigators for three decades with results that are costly, 
perhaps encouraging but short of sustained net energy production. 

The beauty of the Pons/Fleischmann experiments lie in their 
simplicity and I will leave it to them to describe them to you. 

The importance of the promise of so-called "solid-state 
fusion" is enormous. The problem of nuclear waste is largely 
eliminated. The cost of the fuel (heavy water) is moderate and 
its availability essentially unlimited (there is one molecule of 
heavy water in every 38,000 molecules of sea water). The already 
small likelihood of a fission nuclear plant accident is further 
reduced in a fusion plant were one to be successfully built. As 
fossil fuel burning is reduced, a major contribution is made to 
the growing problem of carbon dioxide pollution and the attendant 
suspected warming of the earth (greenhouse effect). Acid rain is 
'eliminated when sulfur containing coal burning is reduced. 

Finally, the world is provided with cheap energy for all the 
purposes to which cheap energy can be put and coal, oil, and gas 
are saved for the valuable chemicals they provide to produce 
drugs, plastics, fertilizers and the like. 

What lead to the Utah experiments? A capacity to see an old 
problem from new perspectives was required. Chemists, 
electrochemists, looked at a problem traditionally reserved to 
physicists. In fact there-in lies some of the humor and bite of 
the scientific controversy that is raging. I would like to think 
that it may not be by chance that it happened in Utah, at a 
university which has encouraged unorthodox thinking while being 
viewed by the world as a conservative, even socially orthodox 
place. There in fact may be something valuable in isolation from 
more traditional centers. America has prospered and innovated at 
the frontier and the University of Utah is still a frontier that 
attracts faculty who highly value their intellectual freedom. 

As these studies are confirmed, they will need to be moved 
rapidly to developmental and commercial phases or we will lose 
their harvest. In a real sense we are obliged to build the first 
floor of engineering and the second floor of commercialization in 
this edifice at the same time we build the foundation of 


scientific understanding. Ira Magaziner will develop this 

important concept. 

In conclusion, Utah and the University of Utah, working with 
able faculty of Brigham Young University, Utah State University, 
and faculty gathered world wide, is a good place to promote rapid 
and novel development. Our political and social system is 
remarkably flexible, a throw-back to frontier times when well-
intentioned leaders could identify, surround and solve problems 
quickly. The environment supports vigorous thinking'and living. 

Additionally we have uninhabited, remote areas where special 
experiments can be conducted 20 minutes from both the university 
and an international airport. The state has appropriated $5 
million to assist. $1.1 million has already been raised 
privately with the promise of much more. We are prepared to 


build a

. novel consortium of federal, corporate, state and 
university resources if you choose to join us. Without federal 
participation the race for competitive leadership will be 
handicapped. 


CHASE N. PETERSON 

Chase Peterson was appointed to be the 11th president of the 
University of Utah in June of 1983. Dr. Peterson grew up in Logan, 
Utah, earned an A.B. degree from Harvard College, and received his M.D. 
from Harvard Medical School. He followed this with post-graduate work 
at the Yale-New Haven Medical Center and service with the U.S. Army 
Medical Corps in Germany. Dr. Peterson returned to Utah in 1962 to 
practice at the Salt Lake Clinic and teach at LDS Hospital and the 
University of Utah Medical School. In 1967 he was asked to be dean of 
admissions at Harvard, and after five years to be vice president for 
alumni affairs and development. In 1978 Dr. Peterson returned to Utah 
to become vice president for health sciences, a position he held until 
his current appointment. In November 1988 he was named chairman of 
the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, 
the lead organization of 149 major public universities. He and his 
wife Grethe Ballif have three children and two grandchildren.

The CHAIRMAN. I thank the distinguished gentleman. 

We will now suspend because we're on a second roll call vote on 
the rule for the supplemental appropriation. Would the Members 
please return as quickly as possible so we can conclude our work 
this afternoon. 
[Whereupon, the Committee was in recess.] 


DISCUSSION 

The CHAIRMAN. The Committee will come to order. 

When we recessed to go vote, we were hearing from Dr. Peterson, 
and I believe you had just concluded. 

Dr. PETERSON. I have. We'll take any questions, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. First let me recognize Mr. Owens and then we 
will see if there's any further questions. 

Mr. OWENS. Mr. Chairman, I would like, before my very brief re-
marks, to point out that the university approached Mr. Magaziner 
earlier on to hire him as a consultant, but he elected to provide his 
services without charge, a rather unusual circumstance for a 
person of his caliber and fees. 

It's a great honor for me, Mr. Chairman, representing Utah's 
Second District, and very difficult to contain the excitement I feel 
in having been able to bring you today not only a marvelous break-
through, but a truly innovative legislative idea. As has been dis-
cussed, the world's industrial record and history of the last 20 
years has been one of transfer of America's discoveries and inven-
tions to Asia and Europe, where superior vision and engineering 
and marketing have given to others most of the commercial benefit 
of American ingenuity. 

Dr. Magaziner has listed them—the microwave, the color televi-
sion, the VCR, computers, supercomputers, memory chips, commer-
cial satellites, satellites, solar cells, superconductors. The list goes 
on and on. A $150 billion trade deficit this year as we live on bor-
rowing from our trading partners. How long will we let this go on? 

How long will we refuse to use the approaches and tools of the 
1980s so that we can win? 

Some say solid-state fusion may be man's greatest discovery since 
fire. Others say, as I do, that it may also be the innovation to pro-
tect and perpetuate the Earth's dying life support system, more im-
portantly than the possible salvation of the dying industrial superi-
ority of America. Man cannot stand another century like the last. 

In those 100 years, we have consumed more of the nonrenewable 
richness of the Earth than was used during all of man's previous 
history. We polluted and poisoned our environment with its use, 
and it literally threatens our continued existence. 

The revolutionary discovery, solid state fusion, arrives simulta-
neously with our entry into the age of true environmental alarm. 

So, bursting with pride, Utah's Congressional Delegation brings to 
this Committee the prospect of a second economic chance and a 
second environmental opportunity. This morning we tell you not 
only of the discovery which may revolutionize the world's energy 
system, but more importantly, it may be the answer to the preser-
vation of our home, Planet Earth. 

Within the next two weeks, the United Utah Congressional Dele-
gation will present you with an innovative legislative plan, one 
which will precipitate a whole new concept for a national partner-
ship for action. It will combine private and public investment and 
the opportunity for America to develop, engineer and champion the 
most far-reaching innovation of our time. 

So I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Committee, 
for your time today, and in advance for your interest in the legisla-
tion which we will soon offer. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank our distinguished colleague for his par-
ticipation and his help in putting this hearing together, by the 
way. I want to thank you very much because I think you've served 
a great purpose not only as a distinguished representative from 
Utah, but on behalf of the Congress of the United States. I'm very 
appreciative of that. 

Mr. OWENS. Thank you. It was a great pleasure, Mr. Chairman. 

Thank you for your very personal and intense interest in this issue. 

The CHAIRMAN. The Chair is going to recognize first the distin-
guished gentleman from California, Mr. Brown, and then he's 
going to recognize the distinguished gentleman from California, 
Mr. Packard, because both of them have other commitments. 

The Chair recognizes the distinguished gentleman from Califor-
nia, Mr. Brown. 

Mr. BROWN. The question that I raised earlier of Dr. Pons and 
Dr. Fleischmann maybe is better addressed to you gentleman. You 
have obviously been studying the possible courses of action, the es-
tablishment of an institute, as Mr. Owens has indicated, but have 
you given any thought to the level of funding that might be desira-
ble at this particular stage in time, and the rate at which we 
should undertake to move, the speed with which we should move in 
this area? 

Dr. PETERSON. We have, Mr. Brown. The first limiting factor is 
our own wisdom and intelligence to be able to put together a plan 
that we all can look at and shape wisely. 

The next limiting factor is money, and we have raised $5 million 
from the State of Utah, 1.1 of private funds has been dedicated. We 
think there can be considerable funds from the private sector. We 
are working with companies and have talked about numbers of dol-
lars that might be put into this sort of thing, some after confirma-
tion, some even during confirmation of the scientific significance of 
this. 

The figure that comes to mind is $25 million from the Federal 
Government. Maybe that needs to be $125 million some day, but 
that's of not any importance right now. Twenty-five million dollars 
would allow us to start the "onion" growing, with State and pri-
vate sources. Ultimately, I would imagine it would be a minimum 
of $100,000, with the majority coming from non-Federal sources. 

Mr. BROWN. A hundred million. 

Dr. PETERSON. Million. I'm in Washington now. I've got to re-
member that. A hundred million dollars would be probably what 
we would expect to raise, with a minority portion of that being 
from the Federal Government. 

Mr. BROWN. And we should move promptly, this year? 

Dr. PETERSON. The third point is, we should move very quickly. 

We propose to have ideas for your consideration literally within 
the next week or two. Mr. Magaziner might want to comment. 

Mr. MAGAZINER. I think the time issue is very, very important 
here. You know, we have consulted in Japan, we have consulted 
with Japanese companies in the past, and we understand the kind 
of effort that the Japanese are now devoting to this discovery, even 
before they've replicated it. I think if we, in the normal course of 
events, wait a year to consider this, or a year-and-a-half or what-
ever, I think we're going to start off the blocks late. So I would sug-
gest urgency. 

And if something does turn up six months from now where the 
science is not what we hope and think it is, then you don't have to 
spend all the money. But I would suggest that you get the process 
going and get the thing going as if it's going to succeed. 

Just like the most successful company in the world, over half the 
projects they'll try to invest in don't work. You know, if that 
causes you not to invest in anything, then you don't get anywhere. 

So I would suggest you move very quickly. 

Mr. BROWN. Well, very quickly around here is not all that fast. 

But I think, just by way of background, you should know that this 
Committee has been looking at the problem that you described so 
eloquently for several years, and included in the Trade Bill last 
year as part of our contribution a proposal for authorizing the de-
velopment of advanced technology initiatives which fit this project 
like a glove. That bill was signed by the President last September, I 
think, approximately, but no money was requested in the budget 
for this year and there doesn't seem to be any process for request-
ing it for next year. 

We have prototype programs in the National Science Foundation 
and a few other places, funded at a low level, most of which could 
not be diverted as a matter of fact. But in an emergency situa-
tion—and you have created—this situation has created a sense of 
national urgency. We possibly could get the administration to re-
quest funding for this generic advanced technology, and a major 
portion of that could be devoted to this, if required. 

This is what I think probably the path that this Committee 
would like to follow, because we also need to look at high definition 


television, superconductivity, several other technology areas, in 

which the problems are identical. We need to move quickly to 
grasp the commercial opportunities as the research base expands. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Dr. PETERSON. Mr. Brown, could I ask Mr. Magaziner to share 
with you just an anecdote of his investigations of what's going on 
abroad. You've got to talk about what time of night you called. 

Mr. MAGAZINER. When I first knew I would be testifying today, I 
wanted to try to get some detail on what was going on in Japan in 
this area. I phoned a colleague over there at what was very late at 
night, about 11:00 p.m. their time, at his home. I asked him to try 
to make some inquires to some friends of his in corporate research 
and development activities in Japan. 

He found them in the laboratory, and then somebody also with 
MITI, who was also at work at 11:00 at night, working on the plan 
for this, that they're going to develop. Because as you may know, 
they form multidiciplinary committees made up of companies and 
university research labs and so on, and MITI is now formulating a 
plan to do that. And both in the case of this one company laborato- 
ry, and also in the case of this person associated with MITI, they 
were working at it at the very late hours. So when I say there's 
some urgency, that's what drives me to say that. 

Mr. BROWN. Thank you. 

The CHAIRMAN. If the gentleman will yield, on the term of urgen-
cy, while the Chairman was over voting—and we just voted on the 
rule for the Supplemental Appropriation—we were faced with the 
following news: that as they will debate the issue this afternoon, 
there will be two amendments that will be offered. One amend-
ment will be offered by Mr. Conte, which will cut $113 million from 


this particular Committee's budget—or, rather, funding—and a 

supplemental appropriation, direct funding. This includes $52-61 

million in NASA, $30-35 million in DOE, $11-13 million in NSF, $2-
3 million in EPA, and about a million in NIST and FAA. 

Then that will be followed by an amendment by Mr. Foley, and 
Mr. Foley won't cut the 113 but he will cut $96 million. What 
you're telling us, believe me, with the greatest of respect, we thor-
oughly understand on this Committee, on a totally bipartisan basis, 
that the new wealth of tomorrow is not going to be created by cut-
ting our throats today. 

So I'm going to have to leave. That's why we've changed our 
schedule a little bit and Mrs. Lloyd is going to have to take over 
here while we go to fight on the floor, to get across to those people 
that it isn't only the $96 million or the $113 million that immedi-
ately exacerbates the 1990 budget, which is the thing we're discuss-
ing now, which will cut an additional $100—automatically cut us 
$102 million before we get any cuts further. 

What I'm simply trying to say to American citizens is that some-
body has got to say to the Congress of the United States, both the 
House and the Senate, that if you're going to create the new 
wealth of tomorrow and you're going to compete, then you've got to 
put the resources where they should be put. Pardon my enthusi-
asm, pardon my aggravation. 

And let me call upon the distinguished gentleman from Califor-
nia, Mr. Packard. 

Mr. PACKARD. Thank you. The last word I had, Mr. Chairman, 
was that Mr. Conte may be withdrawing his amendment— 
The CHAIRMAN. Praise be to the Lord. Now I'll have to go to 
work on Mr. Foley. 

Mr. PACKARD. That's your side of the aisle, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. I know. 

Mr. PACKARD. I appreciate my colleagues allowing me to go out 
of order a little bit. I have a meeting with Mr. Lujan shortly and I 
needed to ask a few questions here. 

Last year we spent—in fact, the last two years, I co-chaired the 
Technology Policy Task Force, and certainly two major items of 
discussion during that year of hearings was the question of applied 
technology and how we can do what has been suggested here in 
terms of trying to keep ahead or certainly keep up with the Japa-
nese and the European marketplace, taking our basic research and 
transferring it into a marketable product. We don't do well at that 
and we discussed that at length. 

The other area was an area I wanted to discuss with the presi-
dent here of the University, and that is, the distribution of NSF 
moneys. How much money has the University of Utah received in 
the past year, to your knowledge, Dr. Peterson, of grant money 
from the NSF? Do you have an idea? 

Dr. PETERSON. Our total research funding level is between $95-
100 million from outside research, and NSF is about $23 million of 
that. 

Mr. PACKARD. My research in the last couple of days has indicat-
ed that almost 60 percent of the total—and it goes into the billions 
of dollars that is distributed—goes to about 20 universities, and 
that the peer review committee or panel that determines the distri-
bution of these funds are representatives in the bulk of the cases of 
these 20 top universities. It's an incestuous—in other words, the 
type of arrangement where the money goes to those that make the 
decisions. 

And there's good reason for some of this being done. There is 
good reason. But it means that small universities, universities that 
are not in the inner circle of research dollars coming through NSF, 
are left out and do not get the money. I have them in my district 
and we have them in Utah, we have them across this country, that 
are doing remarkable things—this is more of a statement almost 
than it is a question—that are doing remarkable research, but 
never have the benefit of national funds to assist them. 

I think that if the truth were known, the University of Utah and 
other schools that are doing some remarkable research in a variety 
of areas that this Committee has some interest in, is not getting 
the funds because, again, it's going to predominant universities 
that historically have gotten huge sums, in some instances one to 
two billion dollars per year. 

Let me ask you this question. The peer review panel that makes 
the decisions in terms of distribution of the funds that come out of 
NSF, has the University of Utah ever been contacted or have they 
ever been involved in that peer review panel, to your knowledge? 

Dr. PETERSON. Yes, they would have been. Vice President Brothy, 
could you give me any—If you're asking about the number of times 
our faculty has served on peer reviews, that would, of course, be 
hundreds of times. Is there any particular panel that would be per-
tinent here? 

But your questions are well put, because the University of Utah 
may lie in about the mid-zone and maybe we can look both ways. 

We are probably the 30th ranking university in the country in 
terms of outside research funding. I happen to be Chairman this 
year of the National Association of State Universities and Land 
Grant Colleges, and they include the Wisconsins and Michigans 
and so forth, and they include 150 other State universities around 
the country. 

We very much want to support the basic theory of peer review, 
because it has served the Nation well; namely, to have presumably 


unbiased, objective people making judgments, particularly about 

the awarding of grants. Now, whether there needs to be something 
else in the awarding of facilities, that's a battle that is going on, 
and it would be premature for me to enter into that battle. 

Mr. PACKARD. I understand, though, that those are different—
that's apples and oranges, the money, the grants for facilities, 
versus the grants for research. 

Dr. PETERSON. Well, some people think they are and some people 
think they aren't, but that's the issue and it's being discussed 
widely, and no one has quite come to grips with where the compro-
mise ought , to be. 

Mr. PACKARD. So in your view, you are not uncomfortable with 
the arrangement as it's now established, but in your view, are 
there universities that do good research work that simply cannot 
get the funds? 

Dr. PETERSON. I think that Dr. Pons himself and his research 
would illustrate perhaps the best answer to your question. He has 
been funded by peer review funding. He has also been funded, if I 
understand it correctly, by funds that were directly assigned to 
him. Is Stan here? 

The way that Dr. Pons would have me say this—and I think I 
agree—is that ongoing research, research that has achieved a level 
of respectability and recognition, is far better funded by peer 
review. But there are many things that are innovative and new 
and haven't reached the level of acceptance, and it is wise for the 
Government to have an alternative pathway. I believe that Dr. 

Pons' funding through the Office of Naval Research has been when 
scientists got together, simply talked over what ought to be done, 
and they said let's fund it. 

Mr. PACKARD. In our national policy task force last year, it was 
obvious to some of us at least that universities that wanted to 
break into the research opportunity simply could not get in be-


cause they had not ha

_ d an experience level, they had not had a 
staff and researchers that were—and thus they were, almost by 
nature of the structure, were locked out of any opportunity to 
begin, that they couldn't get into the entry level of some of the 
funded programs. 

Dr. PETERSON. I think that's the point, the entry level. 

I've served on an NIH panel that tried to think through this 
issue, as to how we might get funding for facilities and biomedical 
research, and what would the criteria be for funding. I've worked 
with Dr. Langenberg, who is the distinguished President of the 
University of Illinois at Chicago, who wrote a paper for AAU two 
or three years ago, and they all were trying to look at this zone 
between the clearly established people and those that have the ca-
pacity to become established with a bit of encouragement. 

Mr. PACKARD. Madam Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity. I 
realize that this< is not the time to make those policy decisions, but 
I think, because of the unique way in which this research program 
has gone, without Federal funding, that it was a time to at least 
evaluate the sizeable amount of money that goes through NSF to 
universities and often leads to these kinds of breakthrough& 


Thank you 

Dr. PETERSON. If we can ever pay back Dr. Pons the $100,000 we 
owe him for the research he did on his own, then perhaps he could 
be applied to invest that in a new investigator. 

Mrs. Luna (Presiding.) Thank you very much. 

Indeed, one of thee frustrations of chairing the Energy, Research 
and Development Subcommittee is to receive testimony such as we 
have received, not on this magnitude, but we recognize fully that 
we are producing more Nobel Laureates and fewer patents as the 
years go by. It is a great frustration. 

One of the major objectives of the Subcommittee in this 101st 
Congress is to really produce some meaningful legislation so that 
we can transfer more technology from our universities and from 
our national laboratories to the marketplace. You're indeed right, 
Mr. Magaziner. There is no way we'll ever get any sort of control 
over our $135` billion trade deficit unless we do take advantage of 
what's corning from our national laboratories and our universities, 
that truly they are the best kept secrets of our country, but they 
are also the storehouse, the treasure house of the new wealth of 
our country. 

In the last Congress, my bill for speeding up technology transfer 
did pass the House of Representatives. It died in the Senate. We 
will be moving and we will be having hearings on technology trans-
fer, so that we can legislate our technologies from our laboratories 
and universities find their way to the marketplace, that we can 
wed the two before the Japanese and our other industrialized part-
ners captivate the marketplace, as we have seen here. 

At the same time, I think it's true that there is a collision course 
between industry people, between business and the Federal Gov-
ernment. It's not true in other countries. We do assume an adver-
sarial role so many times. And this is not always the fault of the 
Federal Government, that private industry is afraid for anyone to 
get close to anything that they're developing, and we're so afraid 
that somebody is going to take advantage of what we've developed 
that we fiddle around and other countries beat us to the market-
place. I hope that we can do a better job in this area because, when 
we held our hearings on superconductivity, we described the tech-
nology as the last frontier, that if we don't move ahead with this 
and the Japanese beat us with this one also, then we're gone. And 
here's another prime example of our responsibility as a nation. 

Mr. Magaziner, what do you feel is the appropriate role of the 
Federal Government in terms of furthering such efforts? You spoke 
of a research institute. I think that really sort of scratched the sur-
face. 

Mr. MAGAZINER. I think with respect to this particular project—
and I think it could serve as a model, which is one reason why I'm 
so interested in it—is I think you can have a basic research insti-
tute and an applied research institute housed in the same house, if 
you will, and have it be one where there can be corporate funding 
for the endowment which is in trade for corporations then getting 
some access to patents at a favored rate if they're willing to under-
write some of the basic research. 

The Federal Government I think can play two roles. One is to 
help underwrite the basic research with grants, but also to do 
something which is done widely around the world, which is to pro-
vide these conditionally reimuburseable loans for the actual com-
mercial development of a product. That's a model that's been used 
effectively in about a dozen other countries. We have it on a very, 
very small scale in a couple of States here, but that's all 
I think the Federal Government role really is not so much one of 
the one who bales out tons of money. It's more the catalyst role, I 
think the kind of role that helps get the thing off the ground, be- 
cause that's something that private industry would have difficulty 
doing on its own. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Now we're back to the question when it comes up to 
commercialization of any technology, that you have the Federal 
Government subsidizing private industry. That's always a real 
stumbling block. 

Mr. MAGAZINER. Right. And I think the way to handle that is, if 
you do it through loan mechanisms, where the Federal Govern-
ment is paid back on a sliding scale, depending upon the success of 
the project, as they do in Japan, as they do in France, as they do in 


Germany, Sweden— 

Mrs. LLOYD. But you can see this is a hindrance that we run into. 


Mr. MAGAZINER. Sure. But

. I think—you know, if it's one where 
there can be a return to the Federal Government for its money, 
where those projects operate in other countries, they operate in the 
black, so that you don t have a net outlay of Federal money, and I 
think something along that model might be palatable. 

You know, this is not an ideological question. I mean, we don't 
have to debate ideologies. It's really a very practical matter about 
how you compete successfully. We may wish that some of our com-
petitors elsewhere were doing it differently, but they're , not. 

They're doing what they're doing, and they're succeeding with it 
We have to react to that. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Dr. Peterson, I have one question for you. I realize 
my time is up. 

To what extent is concern over intellectual property rights and 
patent applications affecting your ability to disseminate the techni-
cal information as a result of the research that was done? 

Dr. PETERSON. We have been sharing that information. Dr. Pons 
and Dr. Fleischmann have spoken at six or seven major interna-
tional meetings since the first announcement. They are actively 
preparing new papers. 

You are correct in identifying the issue of how do you protect 
yourself on patents and still have open, academic publication& We 
think both can be done. Ideas are patented and then put in publica- . 
tions. As you know, the patenting process can be done almost over-
night. 

Mrs. LLOYD. You aren't concerned over the intellectual property 
rights at this point? 

Dr. PETERSON. Yes, we are concerned over the intellectual prop-
erty rights, and we do have, patents on them, but we don't think 
that's holding up dissemination of information. 

Mrs LLOYD. But you do not feel this is an impediment to the dis-
semination? 

Dr. PETERSON. It hasn't, as I've observed it from some distance. If 
you're talking about hours and days, yes, but not, weeks and 
months: 
Mr. MAGAZINER. Could I add one thing to that and that is the 
question of patent rights in other countries: There is a long indus-
trial history now, particularly in Japan, but also in certain coun-
tries of Europe, of American firms having difficulty establishing 
patents in as easy a fashion as foreign companies can in this coun-
try. I would suggest. that this again may be one area where we 
want to take a very close , scrutiny on how the Japanese patent 


a I 

process, the German patent process, worked with these patents, be-
cause they are things that were very clearly developed here. I 
think it may be something the Congress wants to keep an eye on, 
as to how well these patents are granted abroad. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Are you saying that patents to our technologies are 
granted in our country to other countries faster than we can— 
Mr. MAGAZINER. There's no question. The whole process is very 


different. Also, even in— 

Mrs. LLOYD. No, you misunderstood me, I believe. 

Are you saying they can obtain a patent on our technology in the 


United States— 

Mr. MAGAZINER. No, no. Sorry. I'm suggesting this is something 
where we're talking about an international competition that may 
develop, and if we can't make our patents hold in Japan or in 
Europe because of the way they conduct their patent processes, 
that's something that could well be unfair in terms of the way that 
trade should take place and something we ought to look at. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you very much. 

Mr. KETCHAM. Madam Chairman, could you yield to me for just 
one second? 

Mrs. LLOYD. Yes. I yield to Mr. Ketcham. 

Mr. KETCHAM. In your testimony, sir, you mentioned conditional-
ly reimburseable loans. 

Mr. MAGAZINER. Yes. 

Mr. KETCHAM. Could you provide additional research on that for 
the record? 

Mr. MAGAZINER. Sure, I could give you some documentation on 
that. 

Mr. KETcRANI. Thank you. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Mr. Morrison. 

Mr. RITTER. I think I was here. 

Mrs. LLOYD. All right, I will recognize you, then. Mr. Ritter. 

Mr. RITTER. Thank you, Madam Chairman. 

As defined by our Chairman as the "resident stickler" on this 
Committee, maybe I should just dive right in with a question that I 
think goes to the core. 

First of all, before I do, I would like to commend you, Mr. Maga-
ziner. I think you have said in your testimony something I have 
been trying to say for ten years in Congress, and you said it a heck 
of a lot better than I have. It is just an incredible short synopsis of 
where we're not doing as well as we should be doing and how to 
perhaps do better. I think you're hooking up with the Utah group 
is a great combination. 

But, you know, two years ago we were in this Committee room, 
we had a -  full committee hearing, I recall; we had the television 
cameras whirring. We had a lot of fanfare surrounding the covers 
of Business Week, Time Magazine, Newsweek, front pages of the 
New York Times and Washington Post—sound familiar? It was the 
innovations, the inventions, the new research which was coming to 
light in high temperature superconductivity. We had a great deal 
of activity around Washington as well. The President finally got in-
volved. There was a White House conference, there was the ap-
pointment of a Superconductivity Chairman of a group of wise men 
and women, and that report was called the Gomory Report. It thus 
far has not been implemented. Some excellent strategies of the 
type not dissimilar to what you're recommending have not been 
implemented. 

This year, there is a fantastic center, almost one for one, a differ-
ent level of the science. It's more technology, it's more product, but 
it deals with the high definition television, saying, you know, the 
front pages, the evening news. That's out there, too. We are in the 
process of seeking to design a policy there. 

Then you have crucial solid state technologies. As you know, the 
Japanese have really—this is the underpinning of the electronics 
and the soon to be photonics, opto- electronics revolution. Tremen-
dous work has been done in putting together collaborative efforts, 
right, in our competitor nations. 

Now, what makes this, particularly at this stage of the game, 
what makes this particular issue stand above high temperature su-
perconductivity, high definition television, crucial solid state sci-
ences, photonics and optoelectronics? What makes cold fusion the 
one to go for now? 

Mr. MAGAZINER. I don't—First of all, I agree with what you say, 
and I've been watching this for ten years, as you have. I don't 
think it's so much an issue of, is this .science more important neces-


sarily than superconductivity, or commercially more important 

that high definition television. I don't think that's what makes this 
different. 

From my point of view, though, one thing that does make this 
different is that you have a group of people in Utah—and this is 
one reason why I'm willing to volunteer my services to them—you 
have a group of people in Utah who are determined to put together 
an effort in the way that it should be done, and they have already 
started to do that. They are already making the steps to set up the 
institute. You have a legislative grant. You have a number of 
things in action which I think give this an opportunity to kind of 
develop and move ahead in ways that the others didn't have. 

Mr. RITTER. What makes that different, if I might just interrupt. 

I don't think it's that different from the—it's different because it's 
a different subject. But I mean the parameters are not that differ-


ent from— 

Mr. MAGAZINER. No, theoretically it shouldn't be different from, 
say, the superconductor situation. But, in fact, that got off the 
blocks very slowly in terms of thinking about commercialization on 
the part of those who were involved in it, whereas I think the 


people— 

Mr. RITTER. Not in Japan it didn't. 

Mr. MAGAZINER. No, here in this country. 

Mr. Rrrrxx. But I mean the possibilities exist that we will com-


mercialize high temperature superconductors far quicker than 

we'll commercialize this. I mean, you don't know. 

Mr. MAGAZINER. That's right. That's why you have to proceed on 
a number of these things at once. No Government panel or no Gov-
ernment agency should be trying to pick what's going to win and 
lose in a future technology. That's a losing game. I think what 
you've got to do is say that when there are major centers of activi-
ty going on, you need to fund them, and you need to monitor care- 
fully, so that when something does turn out to be a blind alley, you 
cut back. But you've got to fund a number of these steps. 

Mr. RITTER. Basically, according to your argument, though, we 
need to go ahead with high temperature superconductivity; we 
need to go ahead with high definition television; we need to go 


ahead with the material solid state revolution— 

Mr. MAGAZINER. Yes, because—I mean, if you look at the pro-
grams—why can't we do it if the Europeans and the Japanese can? 


The European programs—Eureka, Race, Brite, Esprit—are funding 

500 different projects right now, in all the technologies you're talk-
ing about, spending a couple of billion dollars a year on commercial 
R&D. The agency for industrial science and technology, MITI, is 
doing the same thing' 


 Japan. They're not sitting there deciding 

one or another. They're funding all of them. 

You know, we're a bigger country. Why can't we do that if we 
care about our children? I mean, that's what it comes down to. 

Mr. RITTER. Basically, that's what we have to do, too. 

Mr. MAGAZINER. Yes, absolutely. 

Mr. RITrER. You should get the message down to the floor of the 
House with an amendment coming up. 

Thank you, Madam Chairman. I yield back my time. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Mr. Morrison. 

Mr. MORRISON. Thank you, Madam Chairman. 

Dr.. Peterson, I guess a comment as much as anything. I think 
the need to verify is absolutely paramount right now, and I know 
from my personal discussions with you and our two eminent doc-
tors, that that's uppermost in your mind. 

I just would renew an offer made by Pacific Northwest Laborato-
ries to bring in equipment at no cost to you and be part of that 
reverification procedure. I suppose you're getting that sort of offer 
from a number of different directions. 

Dr. PETERSON. We are, but that doesn't mean that isn't critically 
important. Dr. Pons mentioned that he's setting up the trade of 
equipment and people with Los Alamos, which would be a compa-
rable opportunity—perhaps the wrong State, but still a good place. 

Mr. MORRISON. Well, perhaps not quite comparable, either, but 
that's fine. 
[Laughter.] 
I think all of us are just so eager to do what we can to help, and 
this is one offer that is there and outstanding. I would be pleased 
to help with that. 

Thank you, Madam Chairman. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you very much, Mr. Morrison. 

Mr. Schiff. And I would like to remind the panelists that we do 
have a key witness from Stanford that has a plane to catch, in our 
next group. We want to get him on as soon as we can. 

Mr. SCHIFF. I'll be brief. 

Mr. Magaziner, since joining the Congress, I have heard discus-
sions that you've outlined about the apparent—the fact that 
Europe and Japan appear to be ahead of us in commercialization of 
scientific ideas. That subject has particularly come up on my two 
subcommittees, one Energy, Research and Development, because of 
the superconductor semicollidor proposal, and one on the Space 
Subcommittee because of the manned space station proposal, the 
argument being the American taxpayers will pay for the basic re-
search and somebody else will then commercialize it and reap the 
economic rewards. I'd like to ask you a couple of questions along 
those lines. 

The first is, our Chair asked some questions about the patents. 

Are our patents under international agreements not strong 
enough, to where we develop an idea, to protect those ideas against 
commercialization in other countries? 

Mr. MAGAZINER. Well, there are two things that happen. One is 
that in many cases we've, I think, probably too freely licensed our 
patents to others, and, you know, you maybe get the couple of per-
cent profit that you get from a patent but you don't get the jobs 
and the full economic benefit. But also there have been some 
cases—and we described one regarding coining optical waveguide 
fibers in a book that I've just written, where basically the patent 
processes in Japan and Germany in particular are much harder to 
apply for and be accepted, and secondly, where in some cases as a 
matter of government policy patents are held up and not awarded 
so that a local company can go ahead and do something. 

Now, that local company then doesn't have the option to sell in 
the United States, but they can sell elsewhere in the world. And so 
I think there is an issue with respect to reciprocity on patents 
which I think we ought to look at. 

Mr. SCHIFF. You don't feel that the international accords are 
strong enough when there is an American patent on a particular 
idea? 

Mr. MAGAZINER. No. I mean, a number of these international ac-
cords on patents, and also I would point to GATT and a number of 
other international accords, where a number of our foreign com-
petitors could write an encyclopedia on how to get around them. I 
mean, you know, with GATT, when it comes down to financing of 
exports and so on, there are all kinds of ways to get around it, and 
the same with patents. 

I would commend to you this one story, but also a number of 
others that I could tell about the process that. American companies 
had to go through to try to file their patents in Japan, and the 
delays that took place and so on and so forth. 

Mr. SCHIFF. I'm going to be brief here because of the Chair's ob-
servations on time But I would like to ask, did the Japanese and 
Europeans spend a great deal of government money on commer-
cialized R&D projects? 

Mr. MAGAZINER. Absolutely. That's the main focus of most of 
their activities. All the programs—Eureka, Race, Esprit—in Europe 
are all devoted to commercial research and development They 
have to involve at least two companies working together and pref-
erably working with some research institute that's doing applied 
research with them. And it's precompetitive, but it's shared re-
search. 

For example, somebody mentioned high definition, television. In 
Europe they've been spending a couple hundred million a year for 
a number of years now in cooperation with Thompson and Phillips 
and using these government-funded activities purely on commercial 
research and development. 

The same is true in Japan. The agency for industrial science and 
technology is within the Ministry of International Trade and In-
dustry, and it's the main coordinator of these research projects, 
and they're primarily commercial research and development. Now, 
that's not to say you should ignore the basic research. I mean, 
basic research needs to be funded fully. But they take that other 
step of funding the commercial research and development and 
they'll give money off into companies to do it. 

Mr. SCHIFF. That would be a rather historic departure from the 
way the American Government has viewed its relationship with 
our industry, wouldn't it? 

Mr. MAGAZINER. Well, you know, it may well be not the Ameri-
can way to do things that way; on the other hand, it's not the 
American way to be a second-rate economic power, either. I think 
if the world environment has changed, the competitive environ-
ment has changed in the way things are being done, I think we 
have to adapt. It doesn't mean we should copy somebody else's 
model. I think we can make our own way of doing this. But I think 
we have to recognize that commercial research and development 
has to be publicly funded to match what the others are doing. It's 
not a question of do we think it's right or wrong. It's a question of 
matching what others are doing. 

Mr. SCHIFF. May I ask one last question, Madam Chair? 

Mrs. LLOYD. I regret the time is up. I'm very sorry. 

Mr. SCHIFF. All right. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Mr. Schiff, you may submit additional questions in 
writing for our witnesses for the record. 

Mr. SCHIFF. Thank you, Madam Chairman. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you very much. 

Dr. Peterson and Mr. Magaziner, we thank you for your contri-
bution to our hearings today, and we will be submitting additional 
questions to you in writing for you to respond to for the record. 

Congressman Owens, we appreciate you being with us, and we 
invite you to sit with the panel. 

Mr. OWENS. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman. 

Mr. MAGAZINER. Thank you very much. 

DT. PETERSON. Thank you.

2.': �- 
We also understand-that a good friend of thit COMMitieei Dk. 

James Fletcher Former Administrator of the Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, has decided to return to utab to direct the 
Research Program in this area. �Could ytiti deSCribe for us the 
role that Dr. Fletcher will play in this whole effort and what is 
envisioned for the program? 

ANSWERS: 
Upon the advice of our patent connsel, it is not possible for the 
University of Utah to share research results with other 


laboratories, particularly national laboratories, until the 

information has been incorporated into a patent application and the 
application is on file in the patent office. After that,' 
dissemination to others can, and has, been done. This is the usual 
conflict between science and commercial' interest, exacerbated in 
this case by the potential importance of fusion technology. 

Dr. James Fletcher has agreed to act as an unpaid advisor to the 
University of Utah fusion effort, but not as a full time director. 

He plans to reside both in the Washington,,DC area and in Salt Lake 
City. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Our next panel includes Dr. Steven Jones, Depart-
ment of Physics and Astronomy at Brigham Young University; Dr. 

Daniel Decker, Chairman, Department of Physics and Astronomy, 


Brigham Young University; Professor Robert Huggins, Stanford 

University, Materials Science and Engineering Department; Profes-
sor George Miley, Director, Fusion Studies Program, University of 
Illinois; and Dr. Mike Saltmarsh, Fusion Energy Program, Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN. 

Gentlemen, we welcome you today. We also welcome Congress-
man Nielson, who will introduce Dr. Jones. 

Professor Huggins, you may go first because we know that you 
have a plane to catch. We apologize for delaying you. We hope you 
do make your plane, but we also hope that we have the advantage 
of your testimony as well. So you please proceed. 

STATEMENT OF DR. ROBERT A. HUGGINS, DEPARTMENT OF MA-
TERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING, STANFORD UNIVERSITY, 


STANFORD, CALIFORNIA 

Dr. HUGGINS. Before I begin, I would like to thank the other 
members of this panel for kindly letting me go first. As you will 
see in what I have to say in a few minutes, I'm going to talk about 
the matter of verification, which I think you'll find interesting, but 
with regard to timing, I'm committed to give a technical paper on 
this very subject in San Diego this evening and, in order to make a 
flight, I have to leave rather soon. I do appreciate being placed first 
on your list. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Dr. Huggins, because of this, we will be submitting 
questions in writing for you to respond to for the record. 

Dr. HUGGINS. Fine. I would be delighted to respond to any ques-
tions. 

Mrs. LLOYD. So we will excuse you as soon as you finish your tes-
timony. 

Dr. HUGGINS. Also, if your staff can change my flight, I can per-
haps stay a few minutes longer. 

Mrs. LLOYD. I can't guarantee that. 

Dr. HUGGINS. We'll see. We shall see. 

Dr. JONES. Even Congress has limits. 

Mrs. LLOYD. They say they're working on it. 

Dr. HUGGINS. That's my understanding. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Sometimes they work miracles around here. 

Dr. HUGGINS. Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have this 
opportunity to make a presentation to you on what may turn out 
to be an immensely important topic—the possibility that an entire-
ly new and unexpected source of energy has been uncovered. 

First let me say a few words to introduce myself. I am a profes-
sor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering in the 
School of Engineering at Stanford University. I have been at Stan-
ford for many years, after academic preparation in physics and 
physical metallurgy, the latter at MIT. I initiated Stanford's Center 
for Materials Research and was its director for 17 years. I also 
spent two years in Washington as Director of Materials Sciences at 
what at that time was called the Advanced Research Projects 
Agency. That was roughly 20 years ago. Thus, I have experience on 


 •2 

both sides of the research enterprise, in the acquisition of scientific 
understanding in support of technological development, and in the 
management of research activities from the viewpoint of the spon-
sor. I am keenly interested in the question of how one can most 
effectively translate new scientific progress into useful technology. 

My research group has been involved in recent years in a 
number of matters that directly relate to the recent observations of 
solid state fusion. We were, however, completely surprised by the 
recent announcement of Professors Fleischmann and Pons. 

This so-called "cold fusion" is really a solid state phenomenon. 

For years, my group has been involved in an area called solid state 
ionics, in which we use electrochemical concepts, tools and tech-
niques to study solids, some of which have very unusual properties, 
related to the extremely rapid motion of atomic or ionic species 
within them. 

Especially relevant to the topic at hand is the fact that, as I 
pointed out in a review article some 12 years ago, a number of 


metals containing hydrogen—and thus, also deuterium—have some 

of these same unusual properties, which means that hydrogen and 
deuterium can be rapidly incorporated into their internal crystal 
structures. 

For this reason, we have been studying the properties of a 
number of metals and alloys containing hydrogen because of their 
potential as hydrogen—transparent membranes and for the solid 
state storage of hydrogen. One special program, supported by the 
Brookhaven National Laboratory, involves the use of such materi-
als in a novel concept for the formation of hydrogen and oxygen 
gases by the electrolysis of water at somewhat elevated tempera-
tures. This is closely related to the procedures used in the electro-
chemical experiments that have exhibited "cold fusion". 

There are a number of metals and alloys that under certain con-
ditions have many properties similar to those of hydrogen or deute-
rium-doped palladium. It may, therefore, be possible that other ma-
terials are even perhaps better and less expensive and will also be 
found to also exhibit the characteristics now being associated with 
the solid state fusion phenomenon. 

Now let us go into the subject at hand. Since the press confer-
ence announcement by Fleischmann and Pons on March 23rd, who 
reported the observation of excess heat generation, neutron and 
gamma ray emission, and the presence of tritium in electrochemi-
cal experiments in which deuterium had been inserted into palladi-
um electrochemically, there has been a great deal of interest in the 
possibility that some kind of solid state fusion reaction can occur in 
this and perhaps in other material systems. 

Supportive reports have now appeared in a number of countries 
that similar phenomena have been observed by others. Press re-
ports indicate that this has been achieved in Hungary, Japan, 
Russia and Italy, as well as in the United States. We'll be hearing 
shortly from some of the United States work. 

On the other hand, experiments undertaken in many other lab-
oratories have evidently not been: successful in reproducing the re-
ported effects. This has led to a great deal of skepticism in parts of 
the scientific community. 

As was pointed out at a long session on this topic during the 
recent meeting of the American Chemical Society in Dallas, the va-
lidity of the reported results would be greatly enhanced if there 
were direct experimental evidence of a significant difference in be-


havior between the hydrogen-light-water-palladium system and the 

deuterium-heavy-water-palladium system. Such experiments would 

subtract out any contributions from spurious chemical effects, for 
they would be present in both. 

We in the Solid State Ionics Laboratory of the Department of 
Materials Science at Stanford have undertaken experiments that 
address just that question; that is, whether there is a significant 
difference when deuterium rather than hydrogen is electrochemi-
cally inserted into palladium. 

The results that we have obtained lend credence to the Fleisch-
mann and Pons contention that a significant amount of thermal 
energy is evolved when deuterium is-  inserted into palladium, and 
that this phenomenon is quite different from the behavior of the 


otherwise analogous hydrogen-palladium system. On the other 

hand, except for neutron and gamma ray monitors used for safety 
purposes, no radiation detection measurements were undertaken in 
our study. Others with better equipment and greater expertise in 
such areas have performed experiments of that type. 

I shall not repeat a description of our experiments and results 
here. They are to be presented in full at a meeting of the Materials 
Research Society in San Diego this very evening. That's why I'm 
leaving as soon as I can. 

In one of the more extensive series of experiments, the excess 
power was found to be some 14 percent of the applied power over a 
wide range of voltage and current; that is, the ratio of internally-
generated power obtained from whatever reaction is occurring 
within the palladium containing deuterium to the power supplied, 
through both the deuterium and hydrogen systems, is 1.14. So a 
direct comparison between the two, in this set of experiments, 
shows 14 percent excess energy in the deuterium case. 

In other experiments over longer time periods, at a constant ap-
plied voltage, the excess power generated in the deuterium-contain-
ing palladium cell, compared to that containing only hydrogen, in-
creased continuously, while the temperature of the hydrogen-based 
cell remained essentially constant. 

The ratio of excess power in the deuterium versus the hydrogen 
case, to applied power, the ratio of excess power to applied power, 
rose from 20 percent to over 40 percent over a period of some 52 
hours. We terminated our experiment after 52 hours for entirely 
other reasons that in no way imply that the experiment failed or 
stopped. 

It should be pointed out that our calculations of the excess heat 
generated by whatever is happening within the palladium are con-
servative, in that they do not include the thermal value of the 
chemical fuels formed by the electrolytic reaction. 

This method of calculation has not always been employed by 
others. If the fuel values of the chemical products were to be in-
cluded in our calculation, this would contribute an additional com-
ponent to the excess power, leading to an apparent enlargement of 
the overall effect. 

Because of the direct comparison obtained between the deuteri-
um-palladium and hydrogen-palladium systems as a result of these 
experiments, we conclude that there is an appreciable internal 
heat generation effect in the case of the deuterium-palladium 
system, regardless of the presence of any chemical or thermal ef-
fects in both systems, both the deuterium-palladium and the hydro-
gen-palladium systems. 

We have observed this phenomenon a number of times in more 
than one sample and also in several electrochemical cell and calori-
metric configurations. The magnitudes of the observed effects are 
comparable to those reported earlier by Fleischmann and Pons and 
lend strong support to the validity of their results. 

Now I would like to make some comments on the apparent lack 
of success obtained in other experiments. 

One of the interesting quandaries in this area at the present 
time is why some investigators seem to be successful in the obser-
vation of various effects—neutron flux, gamma ray flux, tritium 
concentration increase and thermal effects—and others are not. 

There are several materials science aspects of the experimental ap-
proach that are critical and which may not have been taken into 
account in some of the unsuccessful cases. One of the two major 
reasons has to do with the preparation and condition of the palladi-
um samples being investigated. Hints concerning this possibility 
have been appearing in the public press in the last few days. 

We shall be discussing this matter in detail in our technical pres-
entation in San Diego this evening, and hope that we can be of 
help to others who wish to pursue experiments in this area. 

We are, however, not in a position to contribute here to the 
debate about the heat generation mechanism. However, a proposal 
made by Walling and Simons that the products of the solid state 
fusion reaction are primarily helium-4 and heat is very interesting. 

If true, this is a very attractive circumstance, for it implies that 
one may be able to generate useful heat without the associated ra-
diation hazards. 

It is ironic that the research program that we are undertaking 
for the Brookhaven National Laboratory is one of the last three 
small efforts still underway in this area in the United States. I 
don't have to remind you about how severely the Federal budget 
for hydrogen-related research, and energy-related research in gen-
eral, has been reduced during recent years. Perhaps now is a good 
time to give this matter new consideration. 

I am sure you will also give some attention to the question of the 
distribution of effort and funding between a few very large and 
very expensive efforts and the possibility of many somewhat small- 
er, yet perhaps more innovative, efforts. I need not also point out 
that essentially all of the major advances in the types of science 
that may have some relevance to our national technological wel-
fare have been in what is sometimes called "small science" rather 
than in "big science". Illustrative examples, in addition to the phe-
nomenon being discussed here, include the discovery of new materi-
als that exhibit high temperature superconductivity and the inven-
tion of the tunneling microscope, which for the first time allows us 
to see the structure of solid surfaces and phenomena occurring 
upon them on a truly atomic scale.

DISCUSSION 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you very much, Dr. Huggins. 

At this time the Chair would like to recognize one of the mem-
bers of the committee, Tom Campbell. 

Mr. CAMPBELL. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I simply wanted to 
be recognized to say at the start what your eloquence has already 
said, that I would urge the committee to take Dr. Huggins' testimo-
ny with, great value and to recognize him as not only a constituent 
but a colleague on the Stanford faculty. Among the differences that 
are obvious between us is that I'm presently on leave. Any other 
comparisons between his professorship and mine would be invidi-
ous to me, so I shan't make them. 

I am glad you're here, Dr. Huggins. We will try to be as brief as 
possible so you can get to San Diego, and you should know that a 
Stanford professor is most welcome in Washington. 

Thank you, Madam Chairman. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you very much, Mr. Campbell. 

At this time we will excuse you, then, if you need to catch— 
Dr. HUGGINS. I would be glad to answer questions, and perhaps—
Could I interrupt for just a second? 

Mrs. LLOYD. Certainly. 

Dr. HUGGINS. How do we stand on the airline? Two minutes. I'll 
be glad to answer a few questions. Perhaps if I could get on a later 
flight, I could answer more. 

Mrs. LLOYD. I was wondering, Dr. Huggins, has your work been 
subjected to outside reviews? 

Dr. HUGGINS. We have submitted a full professional paper to an 
internationally recognized journal. 

Mrs. LLOYD. What further work do you plan to do to either 
expand upon your previous results to prove the validity of the 
Utah work? 

Dr. HUGGINS. May I answer one—make one further comment on 
your first question? We're also presenting this paper this evening, 
in which we will discuss our work in great detail, in San Diego. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Could we have a copy of this for the record, your 
paper or statement? 

Dr. HUGGINS. That is not a written—that is not written at the 
present time. 


Now, you asked what we were doing— 

Mrs. LLOYD. Maybe you can expand upon your work. 

Dr. HUGGINS. Yes. We are pursuing, with as much vigor as we 
can, recognizing the limitations of zero funding in this area. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Your point is well taken. We are also looking at zero 
funding. 

Dr. HUGGINS. My pocketbook has been the major support up to 
the present time. 

There are a number of questions having to do with the important 
parameters involved in this phenomenon, some of which we will be 
addressing as rapidly as we can. We believe that there's a very 
good chance that other materials will show this same phenomenon 
and we would like to pursue that issue, that question, as well. 

And I point out there is a further important issue, and this is 
whether the same phenomenon can occur at higher temperatures. 


Imo 

High temperature, high quality heat, is much more useful from a 
commercial technological standpoint than room temperature heat. 

We believe, from our experience in related matters, that this is a 
very strong possibility, we have not yet done anything in that di-
rection. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Dr. Huggins, I understand a copy of your article is 
being sent to the international journal. Could we have a copy? 

Dr. HUGGINS. I would be glad to distribute copies of that after we 
have heard from the reviewers. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you. 

Mr. Ritter. 

Mr. Rrivsa. Thank you, Madam Chairman. 

You mentioned that the problems, Dr. Huggins, in some of the 
other experiments might have been due to bad palladium, 
impure—is that what you're talking about, the palladium does not 


perform— 

Dr. HUGGINS. There are two major reasons—and I will be dis-
cussing both these this evening at our technical meeting. One of 
these has to do with the method of preparation of the material, an-
other has to do with an additional phenomenon having to do with 
the experiements and their conduct. Both of these are materials 
science problems. They're not problems of electrochemistry and 
they're not problems of physics. 

I recognize that there's been a lot of criticism rin the press be-
cause of the question of the order in which information is present-
ed. On the one hand, everybody is anxious to know what's going on 
and what the latest results are, and on the other hand, we prefer 
to try to work within the scientific community as much as possible, 
and to be as open and free in following the normal procedures. As 
a result, I am trying to be rather careful not to present details at 
this hearing or to the public press before we present them this 
evening in San Diego. That's a regular professional scientific forum 
and that appears to us to be the appropriate place to talk about 
details. 

I will, however, tell you that there are two major reasons why we 
believe many other people have been unsuccessful, yes. 

Mr. Itri-rtR. As someone who practiced a form of materials sci-
ence in a previous life, I am delighted to see that the profession is 
getting involved in this. Of course, palladium being one of the more 
expensive materials known and, of course, virtually monopolized by 
the difficult situation in Southern Africa, a country with a lot of 
problems. It would be fantastic if the materials could move off the 
palladium base, so to speak. 

Madam Chairman, I have no further questions. Thank you. 

Mrs. LLOYD. It's your call. Do you have time for a question, Mr. 

Schiff and Mr. Campbell? 

Mr. SCHIFF. In view of the time, I will pass, Madam Chair. Thank 
you. 

Dr. HUGGINS. Are we okay? I can stay longer, if you like, evident-
ly. My flight's been put off. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Mr. Schiff. 

Mr. ScHm. Am I back on? 

Mrs. LLOYD. You're back on. 

Dr. HUGGINS. Mr. Schiff, yes. 

Mr. SCHIFF. If I understood, Dr. Huggins, you're saying that the 
experiments thus far conducted at Stanford tend to confirm Dr. 

Fleischmann and Dr. Pons' stated results; is that correct? 

Dr. HUGGINS. We are confident that what we have measured is 
correct. We are confident that it's reproducible. The results we get 
on the thermal measurements are comparable to some of' their 
measurements. We have made no other measurements besides 
thermal measurements. 

Other people have done a very nice job of looking for neutrons 
and gamma rays, tritium and so forth. We have not done that yet. 

We've measured only heat effects. But our measurements confirm 
the measurements in the general magnitudes presented by Profes-
sors Fleischmann and Pons, yes. 

Mr. SCHIFF. Do you feel confident that this is fusion? 

Dr. HUGGINS. Pm not in a position to discuss what the mecha-
nism is. I think there are many people who get involved with that 
and at this moment we have nothing further to add. 

Mr. SCHIFF. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have no further ques-
tions. 

Thank you, Dr. Huggins. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you very much, and thank you, Dr. Huggins. 

Mr. Stallings, any questions? 

Mr. STALLINGS. No, Madam Chairman. 

Mrs. LLOYD. At this time the Chair will recognize our colleague 
from Utah, Mr. Nielson. 

Mr. NIELSON. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I appreciate the 
opportunity of being here today. It's rather unique. I graduated 
from the University of Utah and have pardonable pride in that in-
stitution. I taught for 25 years at Brigham Young University, 
where the two gentlemen who are going to speak to you next are 
from, and I got my doctorate from Stanford. It's nice that Stanford 
is one institution that's lending support to the University of Utah 
claim, so I'm in a very interesting position of being supportive of 
all three. 

Let me introduce Steven Jones of Brigham Young University. 

He's been an associate professor of physics and astronomy since 
1985. He received his doctorate at a fine institution in Tennessee, 
Vanderbilt University, and has been a principal investigator for 
the Department of Energy since 1982, working on muon catalyzed 
fusion for DOE's Division of Advanced Energy Products. He has 
also published a recent article, is about to publish an article that's 
been accepted by Nature Magazine, it's been referred to—the 
Chairman referred to earlier today. 

He's accompanied by Dr. Daniel Decker, the Chairman of the De-
partment of Physics and Astronomy, who came to Brigham Young 
University one year after I did, and has been a colleague of mine 
there for many years. It's a pleasure to have them here, Madam 
Chairman. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you very much, Mr. Nielson. 

We welcome you and look forward to your testimony now. When 
you finish your testimony, we will hear from the remaining wit-
nesses before we resume our questioning. 

Please proceed. 

STATEMENT DR. STEVEN JONES, DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS AND 


ASTRONOMY, BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY, PROVO, UTAH 

Dr. JoNEs. Thank you, Madam Chairman and Congressman 
Nielson, for that fine introduction. 

I appreciate sincerely the opportunity to participate and testify 
at this hearing on cold nuclear fusion. I have been a member of, the 
Physics Department faculty at Brigham Young University since 
September of 1985, and actually became active in this type of re-
search, this specific type of research, just about a few months 
before that. 

I would like to, by way of introduction—and pardon my cold, but 
I'll try to speak so you can hear me—I have been active in nuclear 
fusion research since 1979, when I joined the Idaho National Engi-
neering Laboratory. Congressman Stallings may remember that we 
sat on a plane flight from Washington to Salt Lake City together, 
and we discussed> muon catalyzed fusion, which is a precursor to 
the current research, and I will talk briefly about that. 

In 1981 I wrote a proposal to study muon catalyzed fusion, which 
is a form of room temperature fusion, at the Los Alamos Meson 
Physics Facility. Following peer reviews by other scientists, this 
proposal was approved and funding was received from the Depart-
ment of Energy, the Advanced Energy Projects Division. I would 
like to say in the strongest possible terms my appreciation for the 
support that we received from the Department of Energy through 
the years, including funding on this particular project. 

I have been the principal investigator for experimental muon 
catalyzed fusion research then since 1982. Most of our experiments 
have been conducted at the Los Alamos laboratory. 

In the spring of 1985, I began research on cold nuclear fusion 
without muons, the subject of today's hearing. Thus, I have been 
actively engaged in fusion research for ten years, in muon cata-
lyzed fusion research for eight years, and cold nuclear fusion re-
search for four years, so that I feel qualified to make some com-
ments on this subject. 

I would like to start by briefly reviewing muon catalyzed fusion, 
since this form of room temperature fusion has been very carefully 
studied and is closely related to what I call cold nuclear fusion. 

Muon catalyzed fusion was theoretically predicted in the late 
1940s by F.C. Frank, a British professor, and by none other than 
Andre Sakharov. The process was first seen experimentally by the 
late Louis Alvarez in 1956 at Berkeley. This was the first demon-
strated observation of cold nuclear fusion involving, in this case, 
muons. In fact, I have discussed my recent work on muon catalyzed 
fusion with Professor Alvarez several times before his demise. I 
rather wish he were here today in my place. I miss his firm, no 
nonsense voice. 

A muon is an elementary particle, a very heavy cousin to the 
electron. We create muons with large particle accelerators such as 
the one at Los Alamos. When muons are put into hydrogen mix-
tures at room temperatures, or near room temperature, hydrogen-
like molecules form in which the hydrogen nuclei are held very 
closely together. The muon accomplishes this squeezing together of 
the nuclei because it is so heavy, about 200 times more massive 
than its cousin, the electron. 

Without the need for high temperatures, this squeezing effect re-
sults in rapid fusing. As we call this sometimes piezonuclear fusion, 
piezo being the Greek term for to squeeze or compress. It is a truly 
remarkable process that was observed by us at Los Alamos and 
confirmed elsewhere, that the muon catalyzed fusion yields can ap-
proach—that is, the energy output can approach the energy which 
must be invested to produce muons in the first place. We have 
made tremendous strides in the last decade in research on muon 
catalyzed fusion. But I hasten to add that commercial power pro-
duction would require a ten-fold improvement, approximately, in 
current conditions, in current fusion yields. It is not at all clear 
that we can bridge that gap, even though our yields achieved to 
date exceed those seen by Alvarez by a factor of several hundred. 

I would like to show an overhead slide, if I could, to discuss a few 
points related to muon catalyzed fusion with regard to energy ap-
plications. 

Mrs. LLOYD. If someone can dim the lights for us now, please. 

Dr. JONES. Thank you. 

This slide shows the "pot of gold" that we're all hoping for, truly, 
fusion energy. And it is, indeed, a noble and important goal. It also 
shows the obstacles that we have identified in our path of muon 
catalyzed fusion as an approach to realizing fusion energy. 

Now, you notice the Department of Energy watching our 
progress and supporting it very well. We have been able to find 
that the first obstacle, which I won't describe in detail, but that ob-
stacle turns out to be just a mole hill instead of a mountain. 

The second obstacle, however, is the bottleneck in this process. 

It's not clear that we'll be able to surmount that, although re-
search does continue. 

Can you move the little man on the mountain? There you go. 

That's me, or us. He deserves not to be in the river, if possible, but 
on one of the mountains. 

The point is, he's trying to get a shortcut to fusion energy, but 
he's not going to make it. The point is, even after we can achieve 
yields that are comparable or greater than the energy input to 
make the muons, which we have not yet done but we're getting 
close, we still have other obstacles, too, in our path to realizing 
fusion energy, in particular the engineering issues, actually build-
ing a reactor. 

Now, in 1982, our first experiments at Los Alamos showed that 
we had actually achieved what we called scientific break even by 
this process, which means that there is more energy, more thermal 
energy output from fusion than there was energy in the driver of 
the fusion reaction—that is, the muon. Now, that ignores an awful 
lot. That ignores all the energy that must be invested to generate 
the muon. Therefore, this victory was a bit hollow. But I want to 
make a point here. 

The management at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory 
realized that this could be a significant achievement, the achieve-
ment of scientific break even. And so a press conference was 
planned. As scientists, we decided that, well, let's be careful here. 

We need to have our results reviewed by peers and their signifi- 
canoe evaluated by other scientists. After consultation with—and I 
should give, I think, credit to the  management at Idaho National 
Laboratory. They decided let's wait until publication. Let's give the 
peer review system this chance to evaluate the significance of the 
results and then, after three months—you see that time to pub-
lish—we'll decide whether or not we need :to announce this to the 
world. 

Well, at this stage I'm rather glad we did not announce scientific 
break even in 1982 to the world. It's accepted that this is a fact, 
that we did achieve it in 1982 by muon catalyzed fusion. But if we 
had announced it to the world, I'm afraid the public would have 
expected commercial power around the corner. As we see now from 
the perspective of seven years later, this was certainly not the case. 

And so the first point I would like to make is that .I. think at this 
stage, in this research as well, we need just a few months, perhaps 
two months, to evaluate the significance, and in this case also the 
facts, of the scientific discovery. 

I would also mention that there was contemplation of starting a 
cold nuclear fusion center, requesting large amounts of money 
from the Federal Government, as we had achieved scientific break 
even. Those plans were put on the shelf until scientific confirma-
tion, wisely so, and then <were deferred indefinitely as it became 
clear that while the process of muon catalyzed fusion is interesting, 
the possibility of energy applications are distant. 

Now we can turn on the lights. I'm through with muon catalyzed 
fusion for the moment. 

In view of the bottlenecks that we encountered in muon cata-
lyzed fusion, I began with colleagues in 1985 to look for possible 
ways to achieve cold fusion at room temperature without muons. I 
published a paper on this subject entitled "Piezonuclear Fusion in 
Isotopic Hydrogen Molecules". This paper provides the theoretical 
framework for our understanding of cold nuclear fusion to this day, 
although there are some modifications and some other ideas 'in-
volved. This was, I believe, the first theoretical paper that outlined 
in detail this process of cold nuclear fusion. It was published in 
March of 1986. 

Shortly thereafter, we began—Well, I should give credit to Pro-
fessor Palmer of Brigham Young University, who connected this 
notion of piezonuclear fusion with his knowledge of Helium-3 
coming from the Earth, and made the startling hypothesis that ge-
ological minerals or metals might help catalyze nuclear fusion at 
room temperature. 

Professor Johann Rafelski, now at the University of Arizona, 
added the notion that nonequilibrium—that is, rapidly changing 
conditions—would also be important to this process. 

We had several exciting brainstorming session in March and 
April of '86 in which we planned experiments to study and test our 
hypothesis. We have since then loaded isotopes of hydrogen such a 
deuterium into metals. We began this research in May of 1986 with 
electrochemical cells. But we have used various means of loading 
hydrogen into metals, and I should emphasize at this stage that 
there are other ways besides electrochemical that we think will 
lead to cold nuclear fusion at a low level. 

We began to look for the end products of cold fusion—neutrons, 
gammas, gamma rays particularly, but also helium and tritium. 

This work, as I mentioned, was started in 1986. 

We soon realized that in order to see fusion yields, we would 
have to be sure that this is, indeed, fusion. We would have to have 
a very sensitive neutron counter, one that would allow us to not 
only count neutrons but to determine their energy. Because a 
result of deuterium fusion, which we were studying primarily, is 
that fast-moving neutrons are created, whose speed or energy, 2.5 
million electron volts, is characteristic of the fusion reaction. If this 
is seen, then we know that fusion has occurred and not just some 
other reaction. 

After years of painstaking work, we have been able to prove that 
fusion in metals does occur at very low levels by measuring the 
energy of the neutrons produced. Our work was conducted inde-
pendently of that done at the University of Utah, and our results 
will be published tomorrow in Nature, the journal in Great Britain. 

Recent experiments at other laboratories such as Italy, Moscow 
and Hungary, confirm the measurements of neutrons at very low 
rates, similar to the rates measured at Brigham Young University. 

This is not the same as saying that they confirm that energy-pro-
ducing levels have been achieved. These are very low rates. 

I hasten to add here that peer-reviewed and published papers, 
these must be first presented before we can accept these and un-
derstand these results in detail. So far, the findings have not 
passed the scrutiny of other scientists. Even the University of Utah 
paper, as I believe Martin Fleischmann mentioned this morning, is 
called a—I have it here—is called a "preliminary note", interest-
ingly enough. So there is still a great deal of work that needs to be 
done to confirm and certainly understand this process. 

Now, how much fusion energy is represented by these tell-tale 
neutrons? Roughly, a billionth to a trillionth of a watt in our ex-
periments and in these others that I mentioned that measure neu-
trons. This is nothing to get excited about from an energy produc-
tion point of view at the moment. 

Yes, a new door—a new approach to fusion is interesting. A new 
door has been opened. But the gap between the bona fide fusion 
yield and energy production by fusion is roughly equivalent to that 
which separates the dollar bill from the Federal national debt, a 
factor of about a trillion to one. That is an enormous gap. 

How about fusion without neutrons, as claimed for the Pons-
Fleischmann experiments? Here we gain a great deal of insight by 
analogy to muon catalyzed fusion, which has been carefully studied 
for many years. Since the electrolyte contains lithium, it has been 
suggested that perhaps the dueteron-lithium-6 reaction is occur-
ring. This produces alpha particles, helium-4, without neutrons. 

However, lithium-7 is also present in the electrolyte. This reaction 
with deuterons produces a neutron. If the d-lithium-6 reaction 
occurs, then the d-lithium-7 reaction ought also to occur. Indeed, 
lithium-7 is in greater abundance than lithium-6. But this neutron 
is not reported. 

Another difficulty with this explanation is the vanishingly small 
fusion rate that comes from the fact that the lithium nucleus has a 
charge of 3 rather than 1, as the case of hydrogen. In 1957, J. 

David Jackson, a well-known theorist, predicted that d-lithium re-
actions in muon catalyzed fusion would be impossible. So I think 
that explanation is pretty well excluded from what we know of this 
reaction. 

There's another possibility. A normally extremely rare reaction 
which is involving 2 deuterons to produce an alpha plus an ener-
getic gamma would be possible. This has never been detected in 
muon catalyzed fusion. Furthermore, in these experiments, it 
would show up in our gamma detectors. If no other way, by elec-
tron/positron pair production, the gammas would produce these 
electron/positron pairs. But these are not seen. I might add this 
particular reaction would also be deadly at the heat yield claimed, 
or at least very dangerous. 

Okay. So there's another possibility. Perhaps the gamma ray is 
completely absorbed by the palladium lattice, or the energy is 
transferred to a heavy electronic quasi-particle in the lattice. I'm 
sorry I'm getting a little technical. I need to hit this point. This 
condition is a very interesting hypothesis, also a stretch of the 
imagination. But the problem that I have with it is that this should 
produce high energy electrons which would, in turn, produce radi-
ation by the process we call bremsstrahlung. Such radiations are 
absent, evidently, in the University of Utah data, and certainly 
have not been seen at BYU. These should be seen in our detectors. 

Now, we have not attempted to make measurements of heat pro-
duction. Our level of fusions that we've detected, the bona fide fu-
sions, are at such a low level that we have not found it expedient 
to try to measure heat. I will say in passing that I have found that 
palladium electrodes loaded with deuterium have become hot to 
the touch when exposed to the air. I've checked this in the last few 
weeks. This, I believe, is the chemical reaction. In discussing this 
with scientists at Los Alamos yesterday, I believe that's what it is. 

In any case, this was done next to our sensitive radiation monitors, 
and no burst of radiation accompanies this effect. 

I will state it as my opinion—although I must emphasize this 
needs to be checked by numerous scientific experiements that are 
ongoing now and will take months—that the bona fide fusion com-
ponent is a factor of many millions below energy output of com-
mercial interest at this time. Therefore, I make three concluding 
statements: 
First, cold nuclear fusion does not offer a short cut to fusion 
energy. It is another door to take, but it's just a start. 

Secondly, and based on my work of ten years in fusion, and par-
ticularly on cold fusion, I will say that magnetic and inertial ap-
proaches currently represent the best paths to achieving controlled 
fusion energy. I would also add that I believe that funding for cold 
nuclear fusion should come by peer reviews from such organiza-
tions as the Department of Energy and NSF, in an established peer 
review way. 

Finally, I would like to emphasize that cold nuclear fusion is an 
exciting scientific discovery. Let us appreciate it for what it is and 
not decry it for what it is not. I would like to compare cold nuclear 
fusion to this little plant, which is starting to wither—that may 
have some significance as well. This jar, by the way, is the size of 
1.it) 
jar we use for our electrochemical cells. It's one of the jars we actu-
ally use. 

Now, this is a tender shoot, as you can tell. It is difficult to say 
what it will become. Some think and suggest strongly that this is a 
tree, and it will grow up very quickly and provide us enough wood 
for all our energy needs for generations. 

I do not think it is. Let's give it a chance to grow. I think adding 
too much fertilizer at this stage will be detrimental. 
[Laughter.] 
I think we need to give it time, at least a couple of months, 
please, to see whether this is something that's a rose or a tree. If it 
should turn out to be a rose, we can then admire it for its beauty, 
even if we are a bit disappointed it was not a tree. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Dr. Jones, your point is well taken. 

Have you completed your testimony? 

Dr. JONES. Yes, I'm finished. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you very much.

Mrs. LLOYD. We will move now to Dr. Decker. We look forward to 
hearing from you. I think we have your written statements. Any of 
you that would like to summarize, please do so. Be assured that 
your entire testimony will be made a part of the record. 

STATEMENT OF DR. DANIEL L. DECKER, CHAIRMAN, DEPART-
MENT OF PHYSICS AND ASTRONOMY, BRIGHAM YOUNG UNI-


VERSITY, PROVO, UTAH 

Dr. DECKER. Thank you, Mrs. Chairman. I did submit a written 
statement and will be glad, however, to now just speak freely on 
some of my own views and ideas. 

We're grateful to have this opportunity to meet before the com-
mittee, and I'm glad that my former colleague, Congressman Niel-
son, is here to hear us. 

At Brigham Young University, I would also like to say that we 
are very grateful that five years ago, four years ago, that Steven 
Jones accepted an offer to become a member of the Department of 
Physics and Astronomy. He's been a very productive and a very 
worthwhile member of our department. 

I would first like to say and point out, which has been also I 
think well understood by most people, that the experiment at BYU 
and the experiment at the University of Utah are quite different 
experiments. In the one case we are actually looking for a nuclear 
process that is already known, which people understand is part of 
fusion, and at the University of Utah they have been looking for 
heat production, the origin of which we're still quite uncertain as 
to... 

The next thing that we might say is that the results that are ob-
served pt the University of Utah are interpreted by the scientists 
as being unexplainable by normal chemical processes. Actually, a 
nuclear physicist would say—and, by the way, I'm not a nuclear 
physicist; I m a solid state physicist—that I think a nuclear physi-
cist would say, in the same vein, that those results could not be ex-
plained by any known nuclear process. So now we have two un-
known chemical processes or a nuclear process, neither of them 
possible. 

We might ask at this point what is it. It's too early to tell. There 
are many, mostly from the media, many ideas out there floating 
around. In fact, just yesterday I read on the electronic mail that 
the University of Berlin had repeated the energy measurements of 
the University of Utah and claimed that they could definitely show 
it to be a purely chemical process. We've also heard here today—
and I also read that on the electronic mail yesterday—that the 
University of Stanford had fairly strong evidence that it may not 
be a chemical process. So at this point I think that's up in the air. 

We can't tell you whether it's a chemical or a nuclear process. 

It is probably time for these physicists to go back to their labora-
tories and start doing some experiments, instead of giving speeches 
all the time, Steven. 

I would like to also present a few ideas, however, on this dispari-
ty between the nuclear theory and chemical theory, because Dr. 

Pons and Dr. Fleischmann know very well their chemistry; there- 
fnrc. thpv fppl that the anawar to the nrnhlarn PA rmnt hP rhPmiral 
because they understand chemistry and they say it's beyond any-
thing you could imagine by a factor of 100. 

However, looking on the same side of the coin in light of a nucle-
ar physicist, he would say, if you want to consider a branching 
ratio into a fusion process, where nothing comes out—only heat is 
generated within the lattice—that branching ratio is something 
like a factor of 10 to the 12th. So we now have to make a 10 to the 
12th jump in physics, a factor of a 100 jump in chemistry, and to 
try to explain the origin of this energy source. 

I think that gives you an idea of why we feel, at least as physi-
cists, that maybe the chemists should also look very seriously into 
possible chemical reactions and not tell us physicists that we need 
to change our physics to explain the process. 

Now, it is true that any good theoretical physicist can explain 
anything, but I think first we've got to have some experimental 
data to explain. So my plea is to wait. Let's go back and really find 
the experimental evidence, publish it, get it criticized by our peers, 
and then we'll be ready to give some answers here. 

Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Daniel L. Decker follows:] 


REPORT TO THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, SPACE, AND TECHNOLOGY 

Given by Dr. Daniel L. Decker April 26, 1989 
Brigham Young University became involved in "cold fusion" research 
in September, 1985 when Dr. Steven E. Jones joined'the physics faculty. 

He had been working in muon•catalyzed fusion since 1981 prior to coming 
here. 


• 

Muon catalyzed fusion is a Process wherein muons are injected into 
a gas of hydrogen or deuterium. The muon acts like an electron and 
will exchange places with an electron in the hydrogen or deuterium 
molecule but being 200 times as massive as the electron, it reduces 
the distance between the nuclei in the molecule by a factor of 200. 

At this close distance, the tunneling probability of the deuterons is 
sufficiently large to cause the :nuclei to fuse in a very Short time. 

The resulting nuclear products--Helium-3 plus a. neutron or Tritium plus 
a proton--leave with so much energy that the muon is freed to exchange 
with electrons in another H2 or D2. molecule. This process continues 
for the lifetime of the muon (2 x 10 -13  sec). 

Before coming to Brigham Young University, Steve discussed with 
Dr.Van Siclen cold fusion in a solid by pushing deuterium atoms close 
together. For this process, they coined the phrase "piezonuclear fusion" 
and published a paper on the subject in June, 1985. In March, 1986, 
Steve presented - acolloquium at Brigham Young University and discussed 
muon catalyzed fusion along with some of the 'other possible concepts 
for cold nuclear fusion. Dr. Paul Palmer was motivated by that colloquium 
to consider cold fusion as the possible answer for some questions that 
he had run into concerning geology of the earth, such as excess ratio 
of Helium-3 to Helium-4, tritium from the earth and the overall heat 
balance in the earth. He discussed these with Dr. Jones and in May, 
1986, they began experiments with electrolytic cells to deposit hydrogen 
or deuterium in metals and look for nuclear evidence of fusion. 

After a year of encouraging but inconclusive results, it became 
apparent that if any fusion was taking place, it was at a very slow 
rate and would take a more elegant detection system. At this same time, 
Drs. Bart Czirr and Gary Jensen were working on a neutron spectrometer 
for MeV energy neutrons. They decided to concentrate on developing 
this detector system in order to discern whether there was any fusion 
between deuterons concentrated in metals. In late 1988, the neutron 
spectrometer was fully conditioned and preliminary studies were carried 
out on titanium, palladium, tantalum, nickel, aluminum, iron, and 
lanthanum electrodes loaded with deuterium by electrochemical methods 
and gas pressure methods. The results were "tantalizingly positive" 
and those on electrochemically loaded titanium were considered in early 
February to be publishable. 

A complete copy of the paper submitted to Nature to appear April 
27, 1989 will be furnished to the committee and a brief discussion of 
it follows. 


IAA 

In the deuterium molecule where the equilibrium separation between 
deuterons j; 0.74 A, the d-d fusion rate from tunneling is calculated 
to be 10- ' 4  per D2 molecule per second. If one could decrease that 
separation by a factor of 2, the d-d fusion rate from quantum mechanical 
tunneling is calculated to be of the order of 10 -20  per D2 molecule 
per second which is a small but measurable rate. This is about the 
rate needed to explain the flux of Helium-3 out of the mantle of the 
earth. 

The best proof of d-d fusion occurring in a metal loaded with 
deuterium would be to detect the 2.45 MeV neutrons emitted by one branch 
of the d-d reaction. One could moderate these fast neutrons and detect 
them with conventional thermal neutron detectors. This is not easy 
for a low rate of neutron production because one is competing with the 
thermal neutron background from cosmic rays. This method would be 
successful if the experiment is done in a deep mine where the cosmic 
ray background is small. 

In our experiment, a high-energy neutron detector was developed 
which could distinguish the neutron energies. One could then examine 
the neutrons in the energy range near 2.45 MeV. Other events can be 
removed from the background by discrimination techniques. The detector 
consisted of a liquid organic scintillator in which three 61i-doped 
glass scintillator plates are embedded. Neutrons deposit their energy 
in the liquid scintillator via multiple collisions giving a light output 
to the photomultipliers from which this energy can be determined. These 
now low-energy neutrons are then scavenged by the 6Li in the glass and 
a glass scintillation pulse is emitted. The glass and liquid 
scintillation pulse shapes differ and can be distinguished in the 
photomultiplier signals. A liquid pulse followed by a glass pulse within 
20 microseconds identifies a neutron and by pulse height analysis of 
the liquid pulse, the neutron counts can be distributed according to 
energy. 

The counting system is calibrated with 2.9 and 5.2 MeV neutrons 
generated by d-d interactions at 900  and 00  with respect to the deuteron 
beam from a Van de Graaff accelerator. Background runs with this system 
showed a smooth decreasing count rate with no indication of excess 
neutrons in the window near 2.5 MeV. However, when electrolytic cells 
containing titanium cathodes being loaded with deuterium are placed 
near the detector with 10-500 mA current passing through the cells, 
a definite bump appears in the spectrum indicating excess neutrons at 
2.5 MeV energy--4 standard deviations above the background on either 
side of the 2.5 MeV window. This corresponds to a detection rate from 
fusion of 2 neutrons per hour; the background being composed of 3 cosmic 
ray neutrons per hour and 1 gamma/gamma coincidence per hour. Since 
our counting efficiency is about 10% and the solid angle for the detector 
is about 0.1 steradian, this corresponds to 200 fusions per hour in 
this branch of the d-d reaction. 

With a signal this small, one must worry about all possible very 
small sources of neutrons. In our experiment, this diffiCulty is lessened 
since only high-energy neutrons would affect the count rate. One worries 
about diurnal and sunspot activity on rates of cosmic ray generated 
neutrons. A two-week study of this background reveals no diurnal effects 
which is consistent with standard cosmic ray data--the latter also 
indicates less than a 6% variation in cosmic ray level during periods 
of intense sunspot activity. We have looked for as many sources of 
systematic error as we can think of and have confidence in our results. 

A statistician has studied the data and gives a confidence level of 
Several other laboratories have undertaken to check on these results. 

Some have not good enough counting systems and see nothing aboie 
background. Some have good facilities and have reported detection of 
neutrons at levels similar to our results. One group in Italy has 
recently reported detecting neutrons in titanium loaded with deuterium 
in a high-pressure gas system. None of these reported results constitute 
verification for true verification requires publication of a refereed 
paper showing method, technique, results, and analysis. If those 
laboratories have verified our reiults, then such papers will be 
forthComimg. It is too early to tell. 

The world is also very curious about another experiment recently 
performed at the University of Utah. In that experiment, Drs. Fleishman 
and Pons reported finding heat energy liberated at a palladium cathode' 
loaded with deuterium in an electrolytic cell. They argue that the 
amount of heat is greater than one could explain by a chemical reaction. 

There is no present evidence that this heat is related to fusion; even 
by their estimates of fusion rates, the number of neutrons or the number 
of tritiums is deficient by many orders of magnitude. Rather than 
consider the possibility of some heretofore unknown chemical reaction 
being responsible, they prefer to suggest that a violation of various 
laws of physics is, necessary to explain this Pons-Fleishman effect. 

The,only similarity use this experiment and the one .  at Brigham Young 
University is, the 'use of an electrolytic cell. The electrodes, the 
electrolytes and the results are completely different. In the Brigham 
Young University experiment, the emission of neutrons` from fusion began 
just a few minutes after application of current rather than after many 
days. , This could be because of our using a thin foil or a sponge rather 
than solid rods.. In the University of Utah experiment, the objective 
and detection'was calorimetry. Other laboratories have tried to reproduce 
the Pons-Fleishman effect,, many with no success, but there is an 
"off-and-on" verification by the group at Texas A & m and a new report 
from Stanford. Again, whether these represent a real verification must 
await a publication:of a refereed paper where the scientific world can 
see the result in amore precise manner than a news. report. It is very 
difficult to sort truth from rumor by what one observes in the media 
so, in the final analysis, I must conclude that these results have also 
not yet been duplicated. 


I1V 

If the Pons-Fleishman effect is duplicated, we are still left with 
the puzzling question--what is it? Several hand-waving theories have 
been reported through the media. Physicists and chemists in nearly 
every laboratory in the world have pondered this question. To generate 
a theory of a physical effect that turns nuclear excitation energy of 
the order of 10 MeV into lattice thermal energy of the order of 1 eV 
before the nucleus can radiate its energy by emission of a neutron or 
a proton (in something less than 10-20  seconds) is a tall order. That's 
probably not as hard as discovering a means of getting the order of 
1 KeV energy per molecule from a chemical reaction where the electrons 
involved have only about 10 eV energy. Either way will require some 
very subtle reasoning but until that question is resolved, we shall 
not know if the Pons-Fleishman effect represents a new source of energy 
for an energy-hungry world or just a fantastic battery. 

I append the summary of a review of this subject recently written 
by a colleague, Dr. B. Kent Harrison. 

Scientific Comments on the Current Status of the Fusion Matter 
by B. Kent Harrison, Professor of Physics, Brigham Young University, April 18, 1989. 

In Summery: at present, a nuclear fusion source for the energy production at the level 
claimed has not been demonstrated, and indeed is unlikely. Nuclear fusion at much lower 
levels has been demonstrated, but cannot account for the energy. A clear demonstration 
of high level fusion in the present experiments would require a positive identification of 
the actual reaction(s) taking place. 

In the absence of this confirmation, one may infer that the energy source is either one or 
more chemical reactions, heating from a resistance in the electrical circuit, "Peltier" effects, 
in which energy is released at the junctions of dissimilar metals in an electric circuit, or 
more than one of these. All are possible. The Utah experimenters have discounted these 
possibilities, claiming that all have been thoroughly investigated. 

If chemical reactions are the source of the energy, would this constitute a large new 
energy source? No. The virtue of nuclear reactions is that a sizable fraction of the rest 
mass of the nuclear particles is converted to useful energy (by Einstein's famous equation, E 
equals me squared.) However, in chemical reactions this effect is negligible; such reactions 
are similar to ordinary combustion. It is possible in the current experiment that the 
charging of the cell for many hours—which the researchers indicated was necessary—simply 
stored energy which was later released; in effect, then, the cell would simply be an ordinary 
storage battery, not a source of energy. 

If high level fusion is not demonstrated in the current experiments, does that mean that 
it never will be demonstrated at room temperature? No. Continued research is definitely 
warranted, since it is still possible that, by squeezing deuterons from other nuclei together 
sufficiently tightly in some yet to be determined experiment, economically useful energy 
production may be achieved in the future. Many scientists believe this is not possible at 
all. If it is possible, it will likely require considerable time and effort before it is achieved.

ATTENTION: Kathryn R. Holmes

Honorable Subcommittee Members: 
In response to your question: "Could you attempt to predict, or suggest, 
what research directions might be fruitful in an effort to increase the 
rate of piezonuclear fusion, and what the scope of such a program might 
be in terms of resources", I respectfully submit the following comments. 

It is still somewhat early to predict the outcome of piezonuclear fusion 
experiments. The present measured fusion rates are so low that a useful 
energy source seems impossible. However, there are several new 
developments that tempt one to suggest certain areas of research that 
might show some promise. 

It has been quite convincingly argued that the rate of fusion of an 
equilibrium distribution of deuterium diffused into metals is vanishingly 
small and that the small rates that are observed must therefore arise 
from transcient effects in the solid. The observed fusions are probably 
related to some rapid adjustments of deuterons' positions in the structure 
caused by current flow, temperature changes, structural cracking, etc. 

The exact nature of the microscopic processes in the metals are still 
unknown. It has also been observed that neutrons from fusion are often 
liberated in bursts consisting of sometimes 50 to 200 neutrons. The 
fusion rate during the less than 200 microseconds time duration of the 
burst is quite respectable but the bursts are few with long times between 
them such that the overall fusion rate is very slow. 

One line of research that may prove promising would be to study these 
bursts in order to discover what triggers them and use this information 
to attempt to increase the burst rate and consequently the total fusion 
rate.

I so 1) 378 4361 

There are many unsolved problems in understanding the microscopic process 
that takes place within a solid to allow dissolved deuterons to approach 
close enough to fuse. Are there resonances in the vibrational structure? 

Are there cracks that form generating accelerating fields which give 
energy to the deuterons? Could one enhance these effects by 
electromagnetic radiation of a certain frequency or by ultrasonic waves 
in the solid or some other means to cause non-equilibrium in a material? 

All of these problems are in the domain of solid state physics and material 
science. With the answers to some of these questions, then one could 
intelligently ask the question: "How can we enhance the effect"?. 

As to resources necessary: Since most of these research projects do 
not require large machines, the actual resources are not very expensive. 

However, in order to "see" the fusion, very sensitive neutron detectors 
are required which are not available in most laboratories. These are 
not expensive but are rare. I am not accustomed to making this kind 
of cost estimate but I would think ten to twenty million dollars spread 
over several laboratories would be adequate. One of the major expenses 
is in supporting the time for many scientists to devote some serious 
thinking to the project and try out many ideas.

Mrs. LLOYD. The Chair at this time would like to recognize Con-
gressman Bruce from Illinois. 

Mr. BRUCE. Thank you, Madam Chairman. 

This is certainly an interesting and important university seg-
ment, this panel, and their information on fusion research is par-
ticularly important. 

I'm happy that we have on that panel Professor George Miley of 
the university of Illinois from my district. I am pleased that he 
could be with us today. His credentials have been distributed and 
they speak for themselves. 

But I would like to just note to the Committee that he is current-
ly the Editor of the Journal of Fusion Technology and serves on 
several important committees focusing on fusion research efforts, 
and we're happy to have him here and share with us his informa-
tion. 

STATEMENT OF DR. GEORGE H. MILEY, PROFESSOR OF NUCLEAR 


AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND DIRECTOR, FUSION 

STUDIES LABORATORY, UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS, URBANA, IL-


LINOIS 

Dr. MILEY. Thank you, Congressman Bruce. My testimony is 
more lengthy, and I have submitted it, so I wanted to just run 
through quickly some slides. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Your entire written statement will be made a part 
of the record, and you may move ahead and share your slides with 
us, if someone will dim the lights for us again. Thank you. 

Dr. MILEY. Can you hear me from here? 

Mrs. LLOYD. It is a problem. I think if you can have some assist-
ance with the slides and return to the microphone, we will be able 
to proceed in an orderly fashion. 

Dr. MILEY. I'll sit here so I can be by the mike. 

Some people have asked why I'm on this panel. I thought I 
should explain my views. Number one, I'm a long-term proponent 
of fusion in any form, but I've been a pioneer, I think, in the 
search for so-called advanced fuels or aneutronic fusion, which 
would have reduced radioactivity such as is viewed for cold fusion 
as proposed here. I also have always been a proponent of alternate 
confinement concepts, which this certainly is, and I've written a 
book on direct energy conversion for fusion which should reduce 
heat pollution, which is another big problem. So all these pertain 
to cold fusion, and I guess that's why I'm here. 

Next slide, please. 

We do have some experiments in Illinois, but I didn't want to 
talk about those since so much has already been said about experi-
ments without definite results yet. The issues that I had planned to 
cover are listed here, and they are ones that are fairly obvious and 
many have already been covered. A few of the points I will make 
may be somewhat repetitious, but I'll go ahead anyway. 

I would like to get one crack at verification and talk about tech-
nology development needed. What I'm going to do is at that point 
assume that this heat-producing cold fusion occurs, as stated, and 
talk about some of the other ramifications. 

And then I couldn't help but talk a little bit about issues that 
we've already covered, what Congress might do to ensure U.S. lead-
ership in implications and creativity. 

Next slide, please. 

Verification, I feel, has to involve heating and simultaneously 
measurement of reaction products from whatever this mysterious 
reaction is. This is not easy, as people are discovering. But as I've 
already said, I will assume that's done. Let's go ahead to the next 
slide. 

Technology issues have been touched upon, and without knowing 
more about exactly what we're dealing with, it's difficult to go on 
to any great detail. But I've covered a few here. 

Number one, temperature limitations and efficiency. This is a 
very severe problem for the configuration as presently envisioned, 
and it seems to be limited by material considerations along with 
the question of the reaction rate versus temperature. That's some-
thing that has to be looked at very seriously in order to get a 
system that has a reasonable conversion efficiency. 

Materials we've already talked about. It is certainly very crucial 
to fmd other materials not only to reduce costs, availability, but 
also to allow increased efficiency. There's a question of lifetime of 


electrodes, recycle, tremendous problems. There are questions 

about scales, scale and a control. 

I would like to jump down to the next—pull that down a little—


alternate configurations. Dr. Jones just mentioned something 

which seems obvious to me, that there are other ways of getting 
deuterium into palladium or metals that really need to be ex-
plored. It isn't clear that this electric cell is the best approach. Cer-
tainly other approaches might lead to a better efficiency, direct 
energy conversion, if its possible. 

A question earlier was raised about radioactivity. Now, at the 
moment it is stated that some neutrons, some tritium produced the 
bulk of the energy comes out is heat. I would remind you, though, 
that this is operated over a long period of time. The sum accumu-
lates. And so it shouldn't be stated this is without radioactivity. 

We're going to be accused of starting an energy scenario over again 
like we did in fission. The statement there that it was "too cheap 
to meter" will now become "there's no radioactivity". 

That isn't quite true. In fact, one of the crucial questions that no 
one has alluded to yet that needs to be looked at is what other 
fusion reactions might be excited in this fashion. 

Now, on the upside of this good part would be if you could work 
with some that inherently tend to have less radioactivity involve-
ment, D-Hel-3 and P13-11, as I have listed. That might even help 
the seat production more. Who knows. 

On the other hand, there is another obvious difficulty, and that 
is the question of what happens if D-T fusion works. This is a very 
high intensity neutron source which would be cheap. One has to 
worry about proliferation. The final line in this slide, if you would 
move it up a little bit more, R&D balance. There have been a 
number of suggestions about how to carry forward development. I 
tend to agree. I like this approach of a combination of attempts to 
understand the microscopic theory and development of technology 
simultaneously. So I won't say much more about that. 

Could we go to the next slide, please. 

Comments about effect on other R&D research, I guess the one 
true comment is it's going to affect it. If this turns out to be true, 
there's a tremendously strong competition. If not—Now I like the 
thought of all right, let's take some risks and try to develop some-
thing quickly. But if we jump into something and it crashes—I'm 
reminded of the sad experience in the early days of fusion in Brit-
ain, where the ZETA experiment reported neutrons, hit the head-
lines of all the papers, and it was a very exciting time. Then it was 
discovered these neutrons weren't thermal nuclear; they can from 
instabilities. The fusion program in Britain was set back years, 
years. The same thing would happen here if we launch an endeav-
or and view it as a "wildcat" oil well, I'm afraid. Thus, the conse-
quences have to be looked at from a very broad perspective before 
we do something like that. 

The next slide. 

Action by Congress and others. I urge that all of us don't overre-
act and start to put all the eggs in one basket. 

Now, there are some interesting issues, though, that come out of 
all this. At the moment, we've talked about large programs. I'd like 
to talk about small programs because I relate to—since I'm in-
volved in such. 

These discoveries, muon catalyzed, cold fusion, et cetera, have 
come from small groups. It's very important to the research activi-
ties of this Nation that we have seed money to allow smaller-
groups to do the exploratory research, to do that. I think that in 
fusion now, with this possible type of innovation that's coming out, 
there needs to be a mechanism whereby—perhaps a steering com-
mittee or something could pull together the university and indus-
trial and small group exploratory research. I'm not talking about a 
main crash project, but there are so many ramifications and possi-
bilities that the real question is how to get the vigor of the individ-
ual maintained in this. That might be a way. 

I think we need to all recognize and acknowledge that public rec-
ognition of the importance of this new, clean energy source, the 
recognition may not turn out to be possible, but certainly the 
energy crisis has been forgotten, but people now have begun to re-
alize again, with the global warming, et cetera, that this is a prob-
lem that we are going to have to face again. There should be na-
tional goals. 

I feel that fusion—as I've said, I'm a lifelong proponent of this 
fusion. It has so many possibilities, that one of the difficulties of 
the moment is there is no room for funding for innovative re-
search. Something needs to be done. I, in brainstorming, put this 
note "perhaps there needs to be a new office to tie together inter-
ests of DOE, NSF, NASA." DOE has the responsibility and interest 
of ultimately developing electrical production from fusion. NSF has 
the role of basic research, but some questions came up earlier 
about NSF funding. NSF at the moment will not fund fusion re-
search because they feel it's a DOE responsibility. DOE has only 
enough funds to fund their large projects and a few exploratory ef-
forts. There is a tremendous limit and gap between these. It's 
amazing that such a fundamental energy source as fusion cannot 
be supported in this country by the National Science Foundation 
on a basic level. 

The other thing that I would put down is the note that there are 
additional agencies becoming interested and perhaps will want to 
contribute to this effort. For example, NASA is interested in fusion 
with the discovery of the possibility of mining helium-3 on the 
moon and using this for B-helium-3 fusion, and the whole concept 


of fusion space power, fusion propulsion. Thi

s brings in other di-
mensions to this energy problem. 

The last slide, please. 

I simply wanted to thank the committee for the opportunity to 
comment on this extremely important and urgent issue. Thank 
you.

Let me begin by explaining my involvement in cold fusion. First, 
having worked on fusion for many years, I became very excited 
when this now disoovery was announced. So did my colleagues at 
Illinois. We now have two experiments in the Fusion Studies 
Laboratory, one in Chemistry and one in Physics. There have been 
numerous meetings and informal seminars among the interested 
scientists. I am a co-author on a theoretical paper that 
addresses a possible mechanism -- I have put out a call for 
Teohnical Notes for publication in the journal Fusion Technology 
which I edit. Last, but not least, I read the technology section 
of the Wall Street Journal every morning to get the latest news! 

The experiments at Illinois have not yet produced definitive 
results. However, based on other reports, I am personally 
convinced that solid-state catalysed cold fusion occurs and this 
is an unexpected and very important new regime of physics. The 
fusion I refer to, however, is the conventional 1:-4) reaction, 
and the reaction rate is quite low. There is not yet sufficient 
data to evaluate the possibility of a high reaction-rate, heat-
producing reaction such as reported by the University of Utah 
workers. Rather than debate that issue now, for the present 
discussion I will simply assume that this is possible and 
consider some of the consequences. (Let me stress that I hope 
that this turns out to be true, but there are clearly many 
unanswered questions.) 
There are a variety of issues to be considered. These inolude! 

What verification experiments are needed? How attractive is this 
approach for fusion power? What technology must be developed and 
how fast can this be done? What will the impact on other fusion 
research be? Are there special problems such as increased 
potential for proliferation? What should congress do to insure 
that the U.S. maintains a lead in this field? What does this 
discovery imply about creativity-in fusion research in the U.S.? 

I will briefly consider each of these questions in turn. 

A variety of verification experiments are in progress over tho 
world. I do not have time to comment on this in detail but will 
simply note that, In my view, the most important studies are 
aimed at identification of the fusion reaotion products. The 
most likely reactions lead to He-4, He-3, and tritium. 

Measurements are demanding, however, due to the small quantities 
of these products generated, their retention in the palladium 
electrode, and normal contamination of heavy water by trace 
amounts of these e3ements. 

At first glance cold fusion looks quite attractive for power 
production due to the simplicity of the cell. 


However, there are 

a number of issues that must be evaluated before the route and 
time required to scale up to commercial operation becomes clear. 

First, unless higher temperature electrodes are possible, the 
conversion efficiency may be low. Temperature limitations depend 
on the materials employed and'on the effect of temperature on the 
reaotion rate. Both must be studied. A second key issue 
revolves around the availability and cost of the electrode 
materials, the lifetime of the electrodes, and our ability to 
recycle the materials used. In these respects, much depends on 
our ability to find suitable substitutes for palladium. Indeed, 
in principle, there are a number of possible oandidates, and some 
experiments along these lines have already begun in various labs. 

When considering scale up, it should be recognized that an 
electrolytic cell may not be the only (or the most desirable) 
configuration possible. Thus the recent Italian experiment did 
not use a cell of this type but simply cycled the temperature to 
obtain a phase change. One of our experiments at Illinois also 
uses an entirely different approach. One objective in seeking 
alternatives is to find a configuration that offers advantages 
such as more efficient energy extraction, for example a 
configuration that is compatible with direct energy conversion 
techniques. 

Another key "attractiveness" issue is the amount and type of 
radioactive inventory that will be involved in a power producing • 
cell. This strongly depends on what the reaction mechanism turns 
out to be. Though the University of Utah experiments mainly 
produced heat, some neutrons and tritium were detected implying 
a non negligible accumulation of radioactivity over long run 
times. The resulting complications for maintenance and material 
handling must be evaluated. This would be especially critical if 
small "nuclear battery" type units are contemplated. 


Radioactivity issue's raise additional important questions: How 

"aneutronio" is the new fusion reaction suggested by the Utah 
experiments? Can fusion reactions other that D-D be catalyzed 
this way? The ability to use other aneutronio reactions like 
D-He3 and p-D1l would be an important goal. -On the other hand, 
if D-T also works and can be developed into a strong, cheap 
neutron source, proliferation issues could become a serious 
concern. Thus the feasibility of causing fusion reactions other 
than D-D should be studied early in the development of this 
technology. 

Another issue involved in the development of cold fusion is the 


division of effort between theoretical (microscopic) physics 

studies and technology development. Certainly strong efforts in 
both areas are needed. However, it should be realized that the 
basic mechanisms involved may be quite oomplex, requiring years 
to obtain a full understanding. This is not necessarily an 
unusual situation. Consider, for example, supereOnduotivitY. 

This phenomena had been known and used in laboratory devices for 
years before Prof. J. Bardeen and colleagues proposed a possible 


theory. Recently, the discovery of high temperature 

superconductors forced a rethinking of the theory. The theory 
remains unsettled. Still this situation has not stopped the 
rapid development of the technology needed for practical 
applications of superconduotors. Likewise the desire for a 
fundamental understanding should not be used as a reason to 
retard the development of cold fusion technology. A theoretical 
understanding would be a most valuable asset in guiding such 
developments but a balance is needed between basic: research and 
teohnology development. 

Regardless of the outcome of confirmation experiments, cold 
fusion will have an effect on the present MFE and ICF programs. 

If the outcome is negative, the whole fusion community will be 
accused of unfounded optimism (a criticism frequently voioed 
beginning when reports of fusion neutrons from the British 
experiment, ZETA, were widely publicized in the early 1970's and 
then withdrawn). 


If the outcome is positive, the present 

programs will brace for a new competition for what is already a 
very tight budget. 

Regardless of the actual outcome, I feel that congress and all 
concerned must be patient and not over react. Considerable time 
will be 'required to unravel the situation, and great harm could 
be done by acting prematurely, for example by putting "too may 
eggs in one basket." Still, it is clear that cold fusion, if 
real, could have a tremendous impact on future energy technology. 

Quick action is needed to keep the U.S. in a leadership role and 
insure that the subsequent decisions are made with sufficient 
facts in hand. 

The real need at the moment is a supply of "seed" money for a 
number of small groups to carry out exploratory research. Many 
workers such as myself have jumped in using enthusiastic 
voluntary workers, $500 to $1000 for materials, and borrowed 
equipment to get started. However this obviously can't last 
long. Meanwhile there are no easy ways to raise a modest amount 
of support to develop a more sophisticated experiment. Most 
agencies are waiting until the next fiscal year for now starts 
and they typically take a half year or more for reviews. This is 
too slow. Consideration should be given to setting up a 
mechanism for rapid dispersion of "seed" money for exploratory 
and confirmation experiments. A steering committee could carry 
out fast reviews and establish priorities. Also, as in 
superconductivity research, every attempt should be made to 
pull universities and industry together in this effort. 

Finally, several points stand out from the way the ()old fusion 
discovery captured so much attention. The energy crisis may have 
been temporarily forgotten due to more pressing near-term 
concerns, but most people still realise that it is still a 
fundamental problem facing us over the long term. Now the time 
scale appears even shorter than envisioned earlier due to the 
Greenhouse effect, acid rain, planning for more aggressive space 
missions, etc. The development of an attractive fusion energy 
source would be a real breakthrough, and this is widely .. 
recognized by the public. Thus it seems timely and important to 
review our whole R&D program in fusion to see if improvements are 
possible. 

One problem that is clear is that the fusion program has become 
so focussed on current major projects that innovative new 
work is curtailed due to lack of funding. For example,


,  the 

National Science Foundation will not fund fusion related research 
because it is the mission of DOE. Alternate approaches and 
innovative research receive less money eaoh year from DOE's 
Office of Fusion Energy due to obligations to large projects. 

The Inertial Confinement Fusion office doesn't oven fund 
unsolicited research proposals, leaving that to the National 
Laboratories who obviously have other top priorities. This is no 
way to find innovative approaches in an area that should be a 
top national goal. 

Several years ago, as President of the University Fusion 
Association I testified before the Rouse Energy subcommittee that 
a mechanism to fund a number of small innovative projects in 
fusion energy was urgently needed. I am repeating that proposal 
now. The need to establish such a mechanism grows more urgent as 
the necessity for development of new, clean energy sources 
becomes more and more pressing. 

In view of the complexity of the organizational structures 
involved, and the need to out across lines of magnetic, inertial, 
and now cold fusion, the only solution may be to sot up a now 
office to handle this. If so, the new organization should 
encourage and integrate efforts in DOE, NSF and other agencies 
such as NASA, with potential interests. Relative to NASA, I 
would note their increasing interest due to the possibility of 
.lunar mining of 11e3 (a key fusion fuel) and the need for an 
energy aouroe such as fusion for deep spade missions. 

In closing, I want to thank the committee for this opportunity to 
comment on those most exciting and important developments in 
fusion research and development.

Professor George Miley 

University of Illinois 

103 South Goodwin Avenue 

Urbana, Illinois 61801 

Dear Professor Miley: 
I would like to -  express my sincere appreciation for your participation in 
our April 26, 1989 hearing on cold fusion. Chairman Roe and I were 
impressed and pleased at the conduct and substance of the hearing. The 
Members of the Committee, as a result of your report, now have a 
heightened awareness of the significant recent developments and their 
potential far-reaching implications. 

So that we may have a timely and complete record of the testimony you 
presented at the hearing, I would appreciate it if you would send us a 
written reply within two weeks to the questions attached. Please mail 
your response, at your earliest convenience, to the attention of Kathryn 
R. Holmes, Subcommittee on Energy Research and Development, 13374 Rayburn 
Houie Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20515 (202/25-8056). 

I appreciate your attention to this matter, and may I wish you all the 
best for your continued outstanding efforts in the future. 

Sincerely, 


MARILYN LLOYD, Chairman 

Subcommittee on Energy 

Research and Development 

ML:Lel 

Attachment 

Professor Miley, as you are aware the United States has 
for many years funded efforts in magnetic fusion 
research. Do you think that present activities should 
in:any way dissuade'us from that work? 
. �. 

As I indicated in my testimony, I ',do not believe that cold 
fusion should force any near-term changes in funding for the 


older established fusion research programs, (i.e., magnetic 

or inertial,.confinement fusion). We simply do not know 
enough about-cold fusion yet to allow this development to 
disrupt other programs. Not only must the basic physics be 
firmly demonstrated, tut much more effort has to be put into 
understanding how cold fusion can be scaled up to useful 
power plants. As indicated in my testimony there are still 
a number of open questions about scaling, ranging from 
materials problems and economics on through to efficiency 
issues. If cold fusion turns out to be real and , scalable, 
it will no doubt find an important niche in the energy mix 
for the future. However, until much more work is done, what 
that niche may be is not at all clear. Just to give an 
example, assume that cold fusion is found to lead to small 
units and/or battery type operation but is useful for large 
units. In that case, magnetic or inertial confinement 
devices might still be the preferred path for central power 
plant applications. In addition, there may be special 
features that favor one approach over the. other,... For 
example, in space propulsion, if direct drive by plasma 
particle emission is desired, cold fusion does not appear, 
favorable. On the basis of power-to-weight ratio, which is 
crucial in such applications, it is not yet clear which 
approach might be best. In other words, as stated in my 
written testimony, I advocate patience so that a considered 
evaluation of this new approach is possible before any 
drastic decisions are made. The magnetic and inertial 


confinement fusion approaches have received close scrutiny 

over a number of years and they offer some clear advantages 
for certain applications. Cold fusion should receive a 
similar scrutiny and then be compared to the other 
alternatives before a decision is made. 

What work is going on now in Europe and Japan in this 
"cold fusion" field? Are they likely to take an 
aggressive stance on deVelopment of this solid state 
fusion concept should it prove to be correct? 

To my knowledge considerable exploratory work in cold fusion 
has quickly emerged in both Europe and Japan. Indeed, by 
coincidence, I happened to be at the University of Tokyo the 
lay after the newspapers announced this development. The 
mews immediately excited a number of staff there and they 
called me into a conference room to ask what I knew about 
this new discovery. It is clear that they had already 
grasped the concepts and were planning experiments. Since 
then, I know that their experiments have progressed. Also, 
newspaper accounts indicate that the effort is quite 


widespread throughout universities and industry. Most work 

appears focussed on verification rather than scale up, 
however. And, I don't think that the intensity is that 
different from work in the U. S. I doubt that a significant 
difference in effort will occur until a consensus view 
develops in the U. S. Europe or Japan that cold fusion is 
real. Thus one or more of the countries may chose to jump 


into a crash program. However until confirmation 

experiments are reported and scale up issues are better 
understood, I do not believe that anyone has reached that 
point yet. 
3. �Do you think because of the complications associated 


with this experiment, that collaborative work among 

several laboratories would be the best way to proceed 
to demonstrate that the cold fusion process is real? 

What would be your recommendation to the Congress as to 
how to proceed in the matter of assuring that this 
research is adequately supported at least until it is . 
either proven or disproved? 

I stand on my written testimony with respect to support for 
cold fusion research. It is my opinion that the immediate 
crucial problem is obtaining seed money to allow a variety 
of smaller groups to stick out innovative exploratory 
experiments over sufficient time to do sound work. For this 
reason I advocate the establishment of a fund and review 
board to rapidly provide "seed money" support for a 
diversity of small efforts. It was stressed in the oral 
testimony even that the national laboratories have a problem 
because they do not have much flexibility with 
"discretionary funds." I would emphasize that the situation 
is much more difficult in universities and other similar 


research groups. University faculty have virtually no 

discretionary funds since research is funded largely through 
specific grants which require proposals, lengthy reviews, 
and are directed at specific goals which do not allow the 
flexibility of exploratory studies. 

The question also raises the issue of having collaborative 
work among several laboratories due to "complications" 
associated with such experiments. That should certainly be 
encouraged, but I believe the real issue is the 
interdisciplinary nature of topic which brings together a 
variety of areas: chemistry, physics, materials, 
electrochemistry, nuclear physics, diagnostics, etc. Thus, 
I believe that more crucial than collaboration among 
laboratories is the necessity for a group to bring together 
persons with a variety of backgrounds. Thus the 
interdisciplinary character of the working group would be 
e of the factors that would be considered by a board 
msidering "seed" money requests. 
cidentally, I cannot help but add the thought which I 
ought out in written testimony that the need for "seed" 
,ney to support innovative research is not restricted to 
Id fusion. A mechanism like this would be extremely 
tportant to moving magnetic and inertial confinement fusion 
ead also. No doubt there are other areas of science where 
eh an approach is needed too. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you for your excellent testimony. I think we 
can turn on the lights now. Thank you very much. 

Our final witness on this panel is a constituent of the Chair. Dr. 

Michael Saltmarsh is Associate Director for Operations of the 
Fusion Energy Division of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, lo-
cated in Oak Ridge, TN. He obtained his doctorate in nuclear phys-
ics from the University of Oxford in 1966, working at Grenoble, 
France, and CERN in Switzerland, before coming to Oak Ridge Na-
tional Laboratory in 1968. He has worked in the field of magnetic 
fusion since 1977. 

Welcome, Dr. Saltmarsh, and proceed with your testimony. 

STATEMENT OF DR. MICHAEL J. SALTMARSH, ASSOCIATE DIREC-
TOR, FUSION ENERGY DIVISION, OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABO-


RATORY, OAK RIDGE, TN 

Dr. SALTMARSH. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. 

You have on record my written testimony. As many of the things 


that I discussed there have been— 

Mrs. LLOYD. And you may proceed as you wish. It will be made a 
part of the record. 

Dr. SALTMARSH. I'll make it shorter, if possible. 

I thank you for this opportunity to testify before you on behalf of 
my colleagues at Oak Ridge National Lab. I would like to try and 
summarize quickly the status of the cold fusion effort at Oak Ridge 
which I believe closely parallels the status at all of the DOE's other 
major labs and many other institutions with whom we're in con-
tact. 

It's now about a month since the initial intriguing announce-
ments were made by the groups first from the University of Utah 
and later from Brigham Young. Both these groups described evi-
dence that nuclear fusion has been observed to have occurred in 
simple electrolytic cells under conditions where conventional theo-
ries would have predicted immeasurably small reaction rates. As 
has been pointed out, despite the apparent similarities, these are 
quite different experiments with quite different interpretations, 
and most of what I shall have to say applies mostly to the Utah 
experiments, which we have been attempting to duplicate at Oak 
Ridge. 

The news releases, of course, generated a great deal of excite-
ment in the scientific community, as well as the public at large, 
fueled by speculation that the enormous potential of commercial 
fusion power, which this committee is well aware of, might well be 
brought closer to realization. The results triggered an immediate 
and concerted effort to duplicate the reported effects at many insti-
tutions, including Oak Ridge. There has even been the start of 
some theoretical speculation with some papers about to be pub-
lished, that I'm aware of, about possible mechanisms. Thus, the 
normal scientific process of duplication and experimentation aimed 
at understand the new results has begun. 

However, despite the initial high hopes and the apparent simplic-
ity of the experiments, it has generally proved extremely difficult 
to reproduce the reported results. It's clear that experimental de-
tails must be important, but because the mechanisms which pro- 
duced the reported results are not known, we're not sure which as-
pects of the experimental procedures are crucial. The task of dupli-
cation has been hampered by a lack of detailed written technical 
information on the precise details of the original experiments. Cer-
tainly, the scientific process of verification is far from complete, as 
we've seen today. Nevertheless, careful scientific scrutiny will 
eventually provide solid conclusions on the reproducibility of the 
original results and on their interpretation. 

Immediately following the initial news release, work began at 
Oak Ridge to reproduce the new results. Today there are four sepa-
rate groups actively running experiments. They represent a rather 
wide variety of disciplines not normally connected with what has 
now become to be known as the conventional approach to fusion 
R&D. At least a dozen different experimental configurations have 
been tried, most of them attempts to reproduce the electrochemical 
conditions reported by Dr. Pons' group. The table which forms part 
of my testimony shows the chronology of these things and the 
status as of last Friday. 

We have radiation detectors of far greater sensitivity than the 
Utah group, and in one or two cases, of even greater sensitivity 
than the BYU group, which is itself a fairly sophisticated neutron 
detector. Calorimetry is now being used more. Three of the four 
groups are now using calorimetry. However, we're still not sure we 
have replicated all the relevant features of either of the original 
experiments, nor do we understand which are the relevant fea-
tures. 

The results so far have been negative. We have seen neither 
excess heat nor radiation in any of these experiments, certainly not 
of the scale reported by the Utah group. 

It is worth emphasizing at this point that, to our knowledge, 
most of the other institutions with whom we are in contact have a 
similar status to report. At a meeting last week, where all DOE's 
major national labs were represented, they all reported a similar 
level of effort, in some cases greater, and similar results. In other 
words, they have not been able to confirm these results. Nationally 
and internationally, the vast majority of experiments have failed to 
duplicate the reported results, but the details of these experiments 
have not yet been reported in the scientific literature or at open 
meetings. Dr. Huggins' San Diego meeting is probably the first. 

Thus, the process of rigorous review, which has only just begun for 
the original work, hasn't even started for the attempted duplica-
tion. 

It would be a real mistake to try and draw firm conclusions at 
this point. 

The normal process of dissemination of scientific information 
will eventually resolve the problem. More details will become avail-
able and we will learn what are the important questions to ask. In 
the short term, it will be most helpful—and I understand from 
these proceedings it's actually happening—if one or more of the 
major labs would collaborate with the Utah and perhaps even the 
BYU groups by bringing a range of different diagnostic equipment 
to bear on an already working experiment. 

This would short-circuit the difficulties which we and others are 
experiencing in obtaining an effect to study and provide a more 
rapid means of examining and perhaps understanding the original 
results. 

Finally, I would like to say that for me, as for many others, the 
excitement generated by these reports has been incredibly stimu-
lating. Whether these results and their interpretations will be to-
tally or partially confirmed is still very much an open question, 
which can only be resolved in the course of time by careful scientif-
ic scrutiny. Whatever the final outcome, I hope that the renewed 
discussion of the potential promise of controlled fusion power has 
been very healthy. 

Thank you, Mrs. Chairman. I will be pleased to answer ques-
tions.

Before the

TESTIMONY 

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, SPACE, AND TECHNOLOGY 

APRIL 26, 1989 

Michael J. Saltmarsh 

Oak Ridge National Laboratory 

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I thank you for this opportunity to testify 
before you on behalf of my colleagues at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). 

I shall summarize the status of the cold fusion effort at Oak Ridge, which I believe 
closely parallels the status at all of the Department of Energy's (DOE) other major 
national laboratories. 

It is now about a month since the initial intriguing announcements were made by the 
groups from the University of Utah and from the Brigham Young University (BYU). 

Both groups described evidence that nuclear fusion reactions had been observed to 
occur in simple electrolytic cells under conditions where conventional theories would 
have predicted immeasurably small reaction rates. Despite the apparent similarities 
between the two experiments, it should be noted that there are substantial differences 
between the two experimental setups, between the two sets of reported results, and 
between the interpretations of the data. 

The news releases generated a great deal of excitement in the scientific community, 
as well as among the public at large. This excitement was fueled by speculation that 
the enormous potential benefits of controlled fusion power, which are well understood 
by the members of this committee, might be brought very much closer to realization. 

The possible importance of these results triggered an immediate and concentrated 
effort to duplicate the reported effects at many scientific institutions, including ORNL 
and all of DOE's other major national laboratories. There has been theoretical 
speculation as to possible mechanisms which might account for these phenomena, 
with some work (e.g., that of Dr. P. L. Hagelstein at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology) about to be published. Thus, the normal scientific process of duplication 
and experimentation aimed at understanding the new results has begun. Despite 
initial high hopes and the apparent simplicity of the experiments, it has generally 
known as the "conventional approach to fusion research and development. At least a 
dozen different experimental configurations have been tried, most of them attempts to 
reproduce the electrochemical conditions reported by Dr. Pons' group. The table 
which forms part of this testimony indicates the chronology of the ORNL experiments 
with the status as of last Friday, April 21. The first experimental run on March 29 had 
only a neutron detector for a diagnostic. It was assembled using information gleaned 
largely from press and television coverage and terminated fairly quickly as more 
technical information on the original experiments became available. With time, the 
experiments have become more sophisticated and have incorporated more of the 
features of the original work as these became known. Some have been running for 
two weeks or more. Radiation detectors for neutrons and/or gammas have been used 
in all cases. For some experiments, the neutron detection sensitivity is three to five 
times higher than that employed by the BYU group. Materials and equipment are 
available to re-commission a much larger and more efficient neutron detector if that 
should be required. Calorimetry is being employed by three groups at present. To 
date, no observations of excess heat or fusion radiation have been recorded. 

However, we are still not sure that we have replicated all the relevant features of either 
of the original experiments, nor do we understand which are the relevant features. 

Much more detailed descriptions of the apparatus and experimental procedures, such 
as material purity and preparation, electrolyte makeup, etc., are needed than are 
currently available. 

It is worth emphasizing that, to our knowledge, most of the other institutions with whom 
we are in contact have a similar status to report. At a meeting last Wednesday with 
representatives from all of the DOE's major national laboratories, all reported similar 
efforts and similar results. Nationally and internationally, the vast majority of 
experiments have failed to duplicate the reported results, but the details of these 
experiments have not yet been reported in the scientific literature or at open meetings. 

Thus, the process of rigorous review, which has only just begun for the original work, 
has not yet started for the attempted duplication.

The normal process of dissemination of scientific information will eventually resolve 
this problem. More details will become available and we shall learn what are the 
important questions to ask. In the short term, it would be most helpful if one or more of 
the major laboratories were to collaborate with the Utah and BYU groups by bringing a 
range of different diagnostic equipment to bear on an already working experiment.

QUESTIONS FOR DR. MIKE SALTMARSH 

1. It seems that recent experiments have been focused on either calorimetric 
measurements or searching for energetic neutrons from the fusion reactions. 

Would it not be better scientifically to make these measurements simultaneously 
on the same experiment? Is your group now doing work along these lines? 

It is correct that the recent experiments have tended to focus on either calorimetric 
measurements or a search for energetic neutrons from fusion reactions. The 
observation of energetic neutrons is by far the most sensitive method of detecting 
the most likely fution reactions in the systems under investigation. One might 
expect to see neutrons from fusion even when the heat output is immeasurably 
small, but one would not expect to detect heat without the presence of neutrons or 
some other energetic radiation. Thus, it is better to simultaneously measure 
neutrons when making calorimetric measurements, but not necessarily better to 
make calorimetric measurements when measuring neutrons. 

In the case of the ORNL work, all experiments to date have had neutron detection 
capability, although fewer have incorporated calorimetry which takes more time to 
set up. In the most recent experiments, the most sensitive neutron detection 
systems have not been combined with the most sensitive calorimetry setups as a 
matter of experimental convenience. However, should any experimental 
configuration show an effect, all associated diagnostics will be upgraded. 


DISCUSSION 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you, Dr. Saltmarsh, Dr. Miley, Dr. Decker, 
Dr. Jones. We certainly value your testimony. 

Why has there been so much difficulty reproducing the experi-
mental results at other locations in the United States? Dr. Jones. 

Dr. JONES. With regard to the—I'll address with regard to the 
Brigham Young University experiment which show that neutrons 
are produced at a very, as I mentioned, a very low level. To give 
you a number, it's about a thousand neutrons per hour, roughly a 
trillionth of a watt of power equivalent. 

Now, at that level, it's difficult to separate neutrons being pro-
duced by fusion from neutrons being produced by other sources, 
such as cosmic rays. It's just such a small amount of , neutrons. As 
Dr. Saltmarsh mentioned, it requires a sophisticated detector. 

Now, I was at Los Alamos yesterday, I'll be returning there to-
night to conduct`experiments, incidentally, with people there. You 
see, I've been working at Los Alamos for many years, and I have 
good friends there. I'll be working with a couple of groups. 

I think the main reason at our level is that it's just so difficult to 
separate out the background. I will say that we have just begun at 
Los Alamos, really. I learned yesterday in our meeting that there 
is one group that has tried one cell of our type. The other work has 


i 

been done strictly on the Pons-Fleischmann apparatus, which is a 
much higher level of fusion, as you know. And those results are 
negative. I mean, they haven't seen anything. 

Now, at our level, they have done just one preliminary test and 
didn't see anything. But they didn't have the metal salts that we 
use. They didn't have all the salts. I realize it's a Campbell Soup 
use, but there's a history behind that going back to 1986, when we 
began our experiments. 

Anyway, we're not claiming that—Well, that's a scientific. You 
can tell our soup of metals works is optimum. In fact, in recent ex-
periments at BYU, I've reduced the number of salts dramatically 
and I still get the effect, reproducibly so. But now, I agree, it needs 
to be, done. My thought is we need to work together. We will be 
working with scientists at Los Alamos very hard the next few days, 
and then there's another set of meetings, and then we'll go back to 
do some, more experiments. 

But I agree, it has to be done. And the only reason for the diffi-
culty of our results, I would say, the bottom line is that it's such a 
low level. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Dr. Decker, do you feel that because the work was 
directed less toward demonstrating nuclear fusion as an energy 
source and more an understanding of the process could explain 
some of the disparity? 

Dr. DECKER. It could. At least in our case, we weren't looking for 
an energy source, only indirectly. We had hopes, of course, that 
some day this could become an energy source. However, I think 
part of the reason that—You go back to the last question, why it's 
difficult to reproduce or do the same experiment as was done in the 
University of Utah, it is difficult to really know exactly what they 
did. Even with the one paper that has been published, it's not abso-
lutely clear. We need to have more scientific editorials, actually, 
really more publications that really distinguish what has happened 
and explain why. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Dr. Miley, you referred to the level of funding in 
fusion research. If my memory serves me correctly, we're spending 
more in the area of fusion research, in the Subcommittee on 
Energy, Research and Development, than any other energy tech-
nology, so we are giving attention to the fusion R&D. 

How do you recommend that Congress proceed in this matter? 

Would it be so that we can adequately support the research to see 
whether it's proven or disproven? Do you think that a collaborative 
effort among our universities or several laboratories would be the 
best way to proceed? 

As you know, our dollars are limited. We aren't able to fund all 
the programs that we would like to fund, but that is the dilemma 
that we re in at this present time. 

Dr. MILEY. Yes. I think you asked me two questions, if I under-


stood— 

Mrs. LLOYD. I think it was three. 

Dr. MILEY. Three. All right, maybe more. 

First of all, let me talk about the university funding and fusion 
in general. The difficulty is that universities often are trying to 
look at alternate approaches, different basic research in fusion, and 
the national program is aimed at large demonstration types of ex-
periments, and there's a—the two are not completely compatible 
when it comes to money. So what I argue is that this is still an 
area, as is shown with these developments where new and innova-
tive research can come along and it needs to be nurtured, and 
there needs to be a funding mechanism which supports that 
throughout the system, including NSF. That was the first thing. 

Now, the second question you asked had to do with how to go 
about this verification and so on. It certainly seems to me that 
there is tremendous talent throughout the country to do that, but 
at the moment, there is not—there aren't what I would call seed 
money funds to really do it adequately. It's easy to jump in and do 
a makeshift experiment. For example, ours has volunteer help due 
to the enthusiasm and a little bit of money and materials bor-
rowed, diagnostics and what have you. But as we were saying, to 
really unravel this, there has to be a dedicated, longer-term effort. 

So there has to be, I think, some mechanism on the national level 
for seed money to carry out some reasonable but yet very small ex-
periments to understand what's going on. 

Again, I would say the effort in the national labs is commenda-
ble, but you don't want to forget the rest of the community. 

Mrs. LLOYD. We did have the problem of where we are going to 
draw the line, where we are going to look for levels of funding, and 
that's why it seemed to me, if we could have more collaborative ef-
forts on this new vision, it would be helpful to all of us. 

Dr. Saltmarsh, what do you think of the national laboratories, 
with all of their sophisticated diagnostic equipment and facilities, 
working in a collaborative arrangement with our key universities, 
to either disprove or prove this technology? 

Dr. SALTMARSH. I think that's a very reasonable idea. As I said in 
my testimony, I think collaboration with Utah and perhaps with 
Brigham Young. Although Dr. Jones is correct, that's a very small 
effect and it's hard to see, it does make sense. It is much, much 
more efficient in my view at this time than setting up a whole new 
center to look at this. The center Already exists, I think, for the 
verification process. 


If I may make a point about— 

Mrs. LLOYD. Certainly. 

Dr. SALTMARSH. —discretionary funds, I think that is something 
that has come up a number of times here. The national labs were 
able to, with DOE and Congress' permission, use some of our funds 
in a discretionary manner, and that is an extremely important fea-
ture of any large enterprise. That is, in fact, what we're doing this 
work on now, of course. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you very much. Your point is well-taken. 

Your testimony was excellent. Again, we will be submitting ques-
tions for you in writing, and we would like you to answer and 
return for the record of this hearing. 

My colleague, Mr. Brown. 

Mr. BROWN. No questions. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Mr. Idruce. 

Mr. BRUCE. Dr. Miley, in your testimony, in discussion here, you 
highlighted the need for innovative research projects in fusion. 

What specific policies out at DOE should be changed in order that 
there may be more innovative fusion research funded? 

Dr. MILEY. Well, could I begin by saying I tried to stress—the 
basic problem is that DOE is the only agency that has this as a 
major mission, so that the National Science Foundation has a 
policy against funding fusion research, even though it might be 
very basic, due to the responsibility of DOE. So I think one of the 
problems is correcting some of this difficulty so that other agencies 
like NSF can fund basic fusion research. That would be the first 
thing. 

Within DOE itself, I would still stand by the testimony I gave 
several years ago, representing a university fusion association 
before this subcommittee, where it was recommended that a small 
amount of the money be put into an area which would support in-
novative research. I don't know if I want to call it "strange" re-
search, but innovative research. 

Dr. JONES. Can I comment on that? 

Mr. BRUCE. Absolutely. 

Dr. JONES. Thank you. 

There is an existing agency in the Department of Energy that 
does support wild and crazy ideas, such as the ones I've been work-
ing on for years, seven years. That is the Advanced Energy Projects 
Division. That is—they do fund a number of these small, I would 
say, alternative energy approaches, in particular fusion, any ideas, 
a high-risk, high pay off research. Its equivalent to DARPA, I 
would say, in Defense. So there is a mechanism in the DOE for 
this. 

Frankly, I think it ought to be encouraged. Certainly our support 
level has been very generous, what we need. 

Mr. BRUCE. And how does that all relate to university research 
and the national labs, as the chairwoman was mentioning? 

Dr. JONES. Of course, the money that comes from—the money 
that we receive from the Department of Energy through the Ad- 
vaned Energy Projects Division, comes to us—I understand that 
most of the funding does go to universities. Some does go to indus-
try, certainly I know that, and some does go to national labs, such 
as Los Alamos. So I'm not sure I'm addressing your—There is a 
balance there, and the idea is to work—For example, I work very 
closely with Los Alamos National Laboratory, and people at Idaho, 
the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, on this muon cata-
lyzed fusion research. That's funded by this agency. 

Mr. BRUCE. Thank you. 

Dr. Miley, given the comments of both of you about the amount 
of research and funding for sort of independent, small researchers, 
why do you think this was done by two fellows who had no associa-
tion with a national lab and were not funded by any Federal re-
search project? Why, didn't we find these two guys? 

Dr. MILEY. They testified earlier that this was because they were 
somewhat isolated and free to take an independent view. But I 
think it isn't necessary to be isolated to take independent views. 

You can be part of a research program and do the same. So I think 
the real issue is the freedom to do so and also the freedom to study 
basic issues. 

This is one thing I wanted to come back and comment on Dr. 

Jones' comment on my comment. I think it's excellent that we 
have this one program in DOE that they will fund high-risk work. 

However, basic research in fusion, basic plasma research—now if 
we have cold fusion, basic solid state plasma research—needs a 


home. It doesn't have one 

Mr. BRUCE. Even in this innovative section, the Advanced Re-
search Section? 

Dr. MILEY. I'm saying there you have to prove it to work, has 
some possibility of high payoff in terms of a possible project that 
could develop out of it, as opposed to understanding basic physics 
or basic engineering science. It's the basic physics and engineering 
science which underpins our future developments, and in the uni-
versities, it's what underpins our ability to attract the best stu-
dents and train them in basics that aren't going to be outmoded 
with time when one project or another comes along. So that's the 
lifeblood of developing a field, and that's what we need. 

Mr. BRUCE. Thank you, Madam Chairman. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you, Mr. Bruce. 

Mr. Schiff. 

Mr. SCHIFF. Thank you, Madam Chair. 

Gentlemen, I have two areas I would like to ask about briefly. 

One is, Dr. Jones, and I believe also Dr. Decker, you described 
fusion experiments that you had been involved with, and these 
were not high thermal fusion as being studied elsewhere. And yet I 
didn't get the impression they were identical .to the Utah experi-
ments, either. I wonder if briefly, you could compare your experi-
ments to the Utah experiments, in terms of seeking to produce 
fusion. 

Dr. JONES. All right. Of course, the difference in results are dra-
matic. I won't go into that. 

The difference in setup, we have explored a number .of methods 


of loading hydrogen isotopes into metals— 

Mr. SCHIFF. Into what? 

Dr. JONES. Into metals. . 

Mr. SCHIFF. Okay. 

Dr. JONES. I should say, by the way, that this has been funded by 
this same Advanced Energy Projects, this particular idea of cold 
nuclear fusion, since '86. 

Now, we do use electrochemical cells. That was our first tech-
nique of loading hydrogen isotopes into metals. We pioneered that 
in May of 1986. But then in June, we started another—Oh, let me 
comment on that. 

As soon as you get- this idea that perhaps loading or forcing deu-
terons, for example, deuterium into metals is going to lead to 
fusion, which we had in early '86, and using electrochemical cells, 
from there the electrochemical cells can be expected to look fairly 
similar. I mean, there's only so many ways you can do electrochem-
istry. You've got to have two electrodes. We outlined the use of pal-
ladium—I should emphasize titanium has given us better results 
than palladium. I don't know why the palladium price has shot up 
so much. Titanium 'has given us better results. So there is that 
issue. 

The similarity is -  obvious. Once you get this idea that fusion can 
occur in metals, you had to load -hydrogen into metals. Electro- 
chemistry comes to mind. That's the first way that we used. 

We have used other techniques, too, which have since been tried. 

At Los Alamos, we're just going to try that tomorrow, Mr. Schiff. 

I'll let you know how it turns out. You'll hear about it if it works. 

But probably not until a scientific meeting comes along. Next 


week 

Anyway— 

Mr. SCHIFF. Maybe we'll get the research facility at Los Alamos 
if they do well. 

Dr. JONES. Yeah. Now, the idea there is we're adding deuterium 
under pressure, and the deuterium that is forced into metals, we're 
using titanium. We've done some of this at BYU and our results 
were tantalizing but not real significant. 

The people at Ferscotti in Italy used a large quantity of titani-
um, the same procedure, identically, high pressure deuterium, very 
simple, no electrochemical magic or complications. Just pressured 
deuterium on metals. Boy, they got a very interesting fusion rate. 

It's at roughly our level. I'm not talking about energy, again, but 
I'm talking about fusion in metals. We'll try to do this at Los 
Alamos, I believe, in the next few days, hopefully tomorrow. 

Mr. SCHIFF. They confirmed fusion through these other process-
es? 

Dr. JONES. Yes, it's been confirmed twice in Italy, once at Fers-
cotti near Rome, and once by the Genoa group. The Italians are 
very into this fusion fever, too. 

And, by the way, BYU has a collaboration with the University of 
Bologna, and we have some positive results out of that, too. That's 
electrochemical. But again, these are small level neutrons. 

Mr. SCHIFF. Dr. Decker, you're having some slightly different ex-
perimental approach, is that correct? 

Dr. DECKER. Not being Dr. Jones, he does the experiments. I'm 
just the department chairman and watch what he does. 

Mr. SCHIFF. Can I take up a second subject, then, a final subject. 

We were urged, as you may have heard, by the president of the 
University of Utah and by Mr. Magaziner, his consultant, to imme-
diately invest -in, if you will, a research institute on cold energy 
fusion, based upon Drs. Fleischrnann's and Pons' experiments. :I 
don't think I'm meaning *any insult to the gentlemen from the 
president of Utah to suggest I assume he  wants the center to be in 
Utah. I didn't hear him suggest it ought to be anywhere else except 
in Utah. 

The suggestion was that if Congress does not authorize and ap-
propriate the funds for this investment, that next year we'll be 


purchasing cold fusion-powered-automobiles from the Japanese and 

the Western Europeans. On the other hand, I heard Mr. Jones say 
that the difference between that experiment and commercial pro-
ductivity was the difference between a. dollar and the < national 
debt —a low blow, but a fair one, I think, to make before the com-
mittee. And Dr. Miley referred to a ZETA experiment in the 
United Kingdom. . 

I wonder if I could take a second—Dr. Miley, I'm, not familiar 
with that. You referred to it as a fusion experiment in England, 
the United Kingdom, that went awry, I believe. Is that right, sir? 

Dr.1VIrmy. It was, I recall, a reverse field •pinch experiment, 
would say a high temperature plasma experiment. High neutron 
rates were measured there, indicating that they should achieve 
break even =fairly quickly. However, it turned out the neutrons 
were not coming from the bulk of the plasma but due to -interac-
tions that were created by instabilities in the plasma and, hence, 
couldn't be scaled up to a reactor. It was an interesting phenome-
non but not something that led to an ultimate system. And so all 
the publicity which had surrounded that backfired and it really 
caused the public and funding agency to turn against it. . 

Mr. SCHIFF. I think you even testified, Dr. -Miley, that that exper-
iment set back fusion research in the United Kingdom for a 
number of years, if I understood you correct, because of the poor 
result. 

Dr. MILEY. That's my private view. I don't know if they share 
that part of it. 

Mr. SCHIFF. What I'm getting at in conclusion here, and would 
ask each of you briefly, we're being counseled on the one hand and 
we, except for perhaps one of our Members, do not have scientific 
backgrounds. I think you know that. We're being counseled on the 
one hand, "Do it now, or be in second place forever." And = we're 
being kind of implied, on the other hand, "But if it goes wrong, it 
could be more than just an 'oh, well'. It could be a serious side 
effect in addition to cost." 
If you were us, in terms of funding a research center based 
around the cold fusion experiment, what would you do? 

Dr. DECKER. I think I'd still want more confirmation than we 
have right now before I jumped in completely. I'm not sure what is 
meant by a. "research center", but at least from what Mr. Maga-
ziner indicated, he is strongly encouraged that we start off into the 
technology immediately before we have really confirmed very 
much of the science. 

I think there's enough evidence that we should put some money 
into trying to confirm the science and finding out what is truly the 
source of the heat that is observed. I'm not sure we're ready to do 
the technology yet. At least I think, if my grandfather were here, 
he would say to me, don't say "gee haw" to the oxen before you 
attach them to the covered wagon. 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. SCHIFF. Anyone else care to—Dr. Saltmarsh. 

Dr. SALTMARSH. Yes, I would agree. I don't think we're talking 
about a very long time scale here. There's a workshop scheduled at 
Santa Fe at the end of May, where they may get 600 or 1,000 
people involved in this. I don't know whether Steve is right, a 
month or two, but two or three months would be my guess and 
we'll have some fairly firm idea. So I wouldn't rush into it, either, 
not on that time scale. 

Mr. SCHIFF. Dr. Jones? 

Dr. JONES. Amen. 

Mr. SCHIFF. Thank you very much, gentlemen. 

Thank you, Madam Chair. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Mr. Brown. 

Mr. BROWN. Just a comment on the questions raised by Mr. 

Schiff. 

We have, of course, a number of proposals to establish either in-
stitutes or major consortia involving Government, industry and 
universities in fields outside of the fusion field. There is a real 
problem with our ability to utilize the results of our research as 
quickly as other nations are, and it may be that we do need to con-
sider some alternative mechanisms. And fusion would not be the 
reason for that. The reasons would be broader. But a fusion re-
search and development program might benefit from that in the 
long run. 

I would tend to concur that we don't need to act precipitously, 
but what precipitous is, it varies in the eye of the beholder some-
time. We think it's precipitous around here if we get something 
done in two years. We may need to move a little bit faster. 

I wanted to just raise one question. It's obvious from the thrust 
of all the testimony that we've heard that this development has 
stemmed out of a base of research in the field of materials, and 
particularly hydrogen, that's been going on for some time. We have 
programs to fund materials research and hydrogen research and 
various areas, but it has been a question as to whether the level of 
such funding was adequate. I would really like to get out of this 
testimony some support for increasing the funding levels for some 
of the basic research that we have been doing in materials science 
and in hydrogen as ways of utilizing it and ways to—to find cheap-
er ways to produce it and things of that sort. 

This is a leading question. I'm going to ask you to comment 
whether or not you agree that it would be helpful if we could in-
crease the level of funding for basic materials sciences and hydro-
gen. 

If any of you say no, I'll be very disappointed. 

Dr. JONES. You know, I must admit my research focuses mainly 
on finding out scientific facts, and the funding from DOE has been 
so gracious, I haven't had to worry too much. 

But let me say that I do think there is a need in the country for 
support, as I look around and interact with other scientists, a need 
for support for basic research which could potentially lead to appli-
cations but doesn't tie into those possibilities. Because ultimately, 
progress comes from these starts, the new information. Then appli-
cations come later. I think that's obvious. But even though it's ob-
vious, I don't know that we have a good mechanism for funding 
this basic research. 

Dr. Miley mentioned basic plasma physics research and basic 
solid state physics research. I'm sure there are other areas. But I 
do think there is room for small scale, perhaps, but innovative re-
search that should be supported in the basic research areas with-
out pegging that to applications. I definitely agree with that. 

Mr. BROWN. Yes. Well, I'm not calling for research aimed at ap-
plications. It seems clear from this work, from the work in super-
conductivity, from the problems associated with the superconduct-
ing supercollider, a lot of these are materials based problems that 
need a recognition at least that there is more research funding 
needed in these areas. 

Dr. DECKER. I think in the area of materials research, that is 
something that can be done at the smaller universities fairly effi-


ciently— 

Mr. BROWN. Right. It's small funds. 

Dr. DECKER. It's true that a lot of the money does go to the big 
universities with more political pull. It would be nice, even though 
Steve Jones feels all right, I have several other faculty members on 
my department who would like to have funding in our smaller uni-
versity. So I would recommend yes. 

Mr. BROWN. Yes. Okay. 

Dr. MILEY. Not being in that area, I have trouble commenting 
with any expertise. But if you would expand this to say basic 
energy research, then I would say yes. 

Mr. BROWN. Okay. 

Dr. Saltmarsh. 

Dr. SALTMARSH. I really don't have enough information to 
answer the question directly, but a related question which I do 
have some experiences, the discretionary part of any scientific en-
terprise, at LAMPF, at Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility, where I 
was on the program advisory committee for some time, the director 
always used to retain unto himself the ability to direct five percent 
of the beam time on wild-eyed ideas. Similar things have to be done 
at major radiotelescopes and so on, and I think that, in my experi-
ence, is something that often gets forgotten. 

Mr. BROWN. That issue comes up frequently in discussing the 
way the laboratories, the national laboratories manage their own 
resources. I think the chairlady would agree that this subject has 
been one of considerable interest in allowing for more discretion on 
the part of laboratory directors to undertake targets of opportuni-
ty—funding for interesting developments that may not have been 
inserted into their budget two years before when they were prepar-
ing it, but now appear to be promising. This falls within that kind 
of category. 

Thank you. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Mr. Brown, your comments are well taken. I think 
here the subcommittee needs to direct a little bit more attention 
and effort. 

Mr. Nielson. 

Mr. NIELSON. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. 

I only have two questions. The first question has to do with the 


fature article that you 

Pons 

 submitted. You submitted a paper for 

ablication, as did Dr. Pons and Dr. Fleischmann. The editors of 
fature asked you certain questions; they asked them certain ques-
ons. You responded and your article will be printed, their article 
ill not be printed. They said they did not want it because it would 
veal some trade secrets and some patentable processes. 

How is it that you were able to respond to Nature and have your 
:ticle printed with the detail they asked for, and the University of 


tah refused to do so? �

Dr. JONES. Well, I won't attempt to comment for—I think they 
entioned some things, Congressman Nielson, on that. I won't at-
mpt to answer for them. 

For our side, I will say that we have, in fact, done some patent 
vlications, but these do not relate to energy. We don't feel that 
Ley—that energy applications are relevant on the horizon at the 
oment, so obviously—But we have done some patent applications. 
'e've gone ahead and done those, quickly. �
You see, the patenting process, as I'm sure you know, once some-
ing is published, you have a year in the United States to secure 
dents. Well, that's—I don't know a great deal about that. But 
lyway, our patents are in today, as of—you know, they're already 
Mr. NIELSON. The second question relates to the same subject. If, 
fact—You made two comments. You made a comment you have 
be verified, we have to hitch the hoses to the wagon, oxen to the 
Egon, I guess you said. Is it easier to get confirmation from your 
,ers if you publish full article with all the, scientific aspects re-
tested, than it is if you withhold essential details and let every-
dy else try to do it, duplicate it? 

Dr. JONES. Absolutely. The best thing is to publish all the details 
at you can. I mean, after all, we hope for the scrutiny of the sci-
tific community to find out whether what we've done is correct 
not. There is a scientific community out there that's internation-
It's really a marvelous group of men and women, it really is. I 
Lve a great deal of respect as I interact with people all over the 
)rld—Russia, Italy, all over. These people are kind, but they're 
30 very meticulous. And when an idea, especially a new idea like 
is one, hits the scientific filter, it's very carefully checked. Ex-
riments are done, theories are created. But at this point—This 
res me a chance to mention that we are at that filter now. We 
ve not passed the filter, and it will take, I think, a couple of 
mths to pass or not the filter. 

But it's a mechanism that has been developed over, I suppose, 
Lndreds of years, to filter out the wheat from the chaff. Right 
w in the press, for example, it's not their fault that there's a lot 
wheat and chaff out there. The scientific filtering process has to 
given just a little time to filter this out. 

Mr. Nmsort. I want to thank the chairwoman for giving me the 
portunity to say something. Just to make one comment. 

I am very interested in this project work. I have a lot of pride, 
th for me and at the University of Utah. I would like very much 
for it to be true, and I hope against hope that we can verify that to 
everyone's satisfaction and that this committee -Will provide the 
proper funding. 

I really believe that we should take certain risks. Someone said a 
certain amount of money should go to test things out. So I'm going 
to support the recommendation that Mr. Walker made, and per-
haps the higher one as well, because I think it's an important in-
vestment. A very little bit of money could produce a tremendous 
return for the country, and I would like to see our country get the 
first crack at it. 

But I'm like you. I would like to see all the details published in 
such a way that it can be verified and repeated, because then you 
have the whole world at your feet. I believe that's the suggestion I 
would make to the chairwoman. 

Thank you again. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you very much, Mr. Nielson. 

Thank you, distinguished panelists. You have provided excellent 
testimony and we're very appreciative. 

Our final panel of witnesses today includes Dr. Harold Furth, 
who is certainly no stranger to this committee. He is director of the 
Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton University, Princeton, NY, 
and Dr. Ron Ballinger from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
in the Nuclear Engineering Department. 

Gentlemen, welcome. It's good to see you this afternoon. We are 
running a little over time, but I think you'll agree that the testimo-
ny has been excellent. Harold, you may proceed as you wish. Your 
entire statement will be made a part of the record. 

STATEMENT OF DR. HAROLD P. FURTH, DIRECTOR, PRINCETON 


PLASMA PHYSICS LABORATORY, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY 

Dr. FURTH. Madam Chairman, members of the committee, thank 
you for inviting me. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Please turn on your speaker, Dr. Furth. 

Dr. FURTH. Thank you once more for inviting me. 

The subject of my written testimony is the verification of the re-
ality of cold fusion, and without going once more into all the nitty-
gritties of that, I would like to summarize the main points of logic 
for you which have been mentioned also by previous speakers. 

Now, one very important remarks is that there is not one kind of 
cold fusion; there are two kinds of cold fusion, which are quite dis-
tinct, and one might call the one calorimetric cold fusion because 
what one does there is to use a calorimeter and discover excess 
heat which it is believed cannot be accounted for by chemical 
means. That is the heart of the most exciting discovery made at 
the University of Utah. 

But then, quite separate from that, there is nuclear cold fusion, 
where you make nuclear reaction product measurements and you 
infer that accompanying heat, of course, has been released, and 
that has been done at Brigham Young and a number of other 
places, including also the University of Utah. 

Now, those two findings so far inhabit quite different worlds, and 
it is not yet clear, in fact, that there is a connection between them. 

For instance, one could ask do the findings or nonfmdings of nucle- 
ar cold fusion evidence, do they serve a useful purpose in proving 
or disproving the reality of the calorimetric cold fusion, and the 
answer is no. As you heard over and over today, they are in differ-
ent worlds which are apart by at least a factor of a billion, and to 
come, up with a new example of that, which I think is becoming 
increasingly timely, that factor is sort of like the difference be-
tween your personal lunch money and feeding the whole human 
race. That's quite a large factor. Therefore, coming up with the 
lunch money doesn't fee the human race, and coming up with some 
billionth of the energy release, inferring that from nuclear reaction 
products, doesn't account for the energy release. 

But on the bright side, the opposite is also true, that if one 
should fail to confirm the reality of the nuclear evidence, that 
wouldn't damage necessarily the reality of the calorimetric evi-
dence. Because at the moment, the argument is that the excess 
heat is not produced by known fusion reactions at all, but , it is pro-
duced by a new kind of fusion reaction not previously known which 
does not have visible nuclear reaction product& And so if all evi-
dence of nuclear cold fusion went away, it would not undermine 
the case for calorimetric cold fusion. So in a sense, they're really 
quite separate. 

In order to verify the reality of the calorimetric cold fusion, one 
has to explore it by calorimetric and chemical means, and there a 
number of approaches are really quite obvious. One experiment is 
to do the light water control experiment This was discussed two 
weeks ago at the American Chemical Society meeting in Dallas. 

The idea here is that when you have found, or think you have 
found, excess heat in heavy water, then you repeat the experiment 
in light water and see if there is excess heat there. 

Now, Dr. Huggins here has said he has done this and has found 
the , excess heat in heavy water, not in light water. There are other 
groups who have had precisely the reverse result, and there are 
still other grOups who have found excess heat in neither heavy 
water nor light water, from all of which I conclude merely that 
they can't all be right and I leave it to the electrochemists to sort 
out the truth. 

I am rather struck by the notion that the University of Utah 
surely must have considered doing control experiments in light 
water after these many results in heavy water, and I was struck by 
the remark of Dr. Fleischmann when the subject came up here, 
namely, that he didn't want to talk about it. So I would say, if I 
were Sherlock Holmes, I would refer to this as 'The Case of the 
Missing Control Experiment" and I would ponder what it meant. I 
have a feeling it does mean something, and it is conceivable to me 
that if this committee were to encourage Dr. Fleischmann and Dr. 

Pons to say something further on this topic, they may, indeed, have 
already further things to say. Indeed, they may have control exper-
iements. It is just that this is among the evidence that has not yet 
been laid on the table. 

Now, aside from these calorimetric experiments to seek to verify 
the reality of the excess heat as fusion, one very obvious thing to 
do, which has occurred to many people, is to look for helium pro-
duction, because so far, even the most erudite and elegant of our 
theorists have not been able to find a way to release microscopic 
heat without either visible radiation or helium production. There-
fore, in the heart of these palladium rods there must be lurking 
helium which accumulates as the excess heat is produced. And 
here, what one should not do is just see if there is some helium, 
because there is some helium everywhere—in metal, in glass—
ready to come out. What you should look for is a very specific 
thing, namely, that the helium accumulates as it is produced in the 
course of these alleged exotic new fusion reactions, and it should 
then be produced in a very definite known ratio between helium 
and excess heat. 

So what I would recommend is very simple, could really be done 
in a matter of a week, that people who have done successful excess 
heat experiments should chop up of few rods, and let's have some 
that have produced a lot of heat and some that have produced a 
little heat, and some that haven't produced any heat at all, and 
we'll number them and we'll make a little list saying just how 
much heat each produced and we'll send them out to a laboratory 
that does analyses of helium. Then they will make a little list of 
how much helium there is in these rods, and then we will put to-
gether those two lists. That, to me, would be an enormously inter-
esting and significant test, which could be carried out next week, 
not next month or next year. 

Okay. So I have said by way of introduction that the nuclear cold 
fusion effects don't have the capability to prove or disprove this mi-
croscopic calorimetric cold fusion. 

The reverse is also true, that if it were to happen that all the 
excess heat in the end were, after all, explained by chemical 
means, that would not necessarily caste out the nuclear cold fusion 
results such as those reported here by Dr. Jones. They also, al-
though not of such obvious dramatic energy interest, are of great 
physical, interest and should be pursued. Now, those, again, need to 
be investigated by the techniques of nuclear physics. One has to 
make sure that the signals are above the background; one has to 
make sure one is really seeing neutrons from fusion events and not 
from some other cause, and so forth. 

In conclusion, let me echo a statement very eloquently expressed 
by Dr. Fleischmann, namely, the overriding fact in this situation is 
that society needs fusion, and the great positive future to me of the 
recent events is that they have drawn the attention of society very 
vigorously, far more vigorously than we could have done, I'm sure, 
to this need for fusion as the great energy crunch of the next cen-
tury comes into view and as we need to prepare to deal with it in 
some economical and environmentally benign manner. 

So that's a very great plus. But the immediate need is verifica-
tion of the reality of the thing that we've been talking about for 
the last six hours. That is a very fundamental point. 

It's certainly true that one should not waste too much time in a 
breakthrough situation going from science into technology. It's 
wonderful if you can overlap it, but don't skip the verification 
stage, particularly if it is really only in some cases a matter of 
weeks and in other cases a matter of months, or one month. So I 
think the committee could do a wonderful service by focusing at-
tention on that point. 

If that is done, then the truth will come out in fairly short order. 

Then maybe it will point one way or maybe it'll point another way, 
and in either case, we should pursue the best road to fusion power, 
and we should make a good plan, and maybe, in view of what has 
been happening recently, we will pursue that plan somewhat more 
expeditiously and vigorously than fusion power has been pursued 
in recent years. 

I know that in this case I'm only telling Mrs. Lloyd and Mr. Roe 
what they well know. They have been wonderfully forceful and in-
sightful in supporting fusion over the years, and I have full confi-
dence that they will find the right way. 


Thank you very muck 

[The prepared statement of Harold Furth, plus additional ques-
tions and answers for the record follow:] 


Statement of Harold P. Furth 

Director, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory 

before the 

House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology 

26 April 1989 

Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee: 
Thank you for inviting me to comment on the subject of "cold 
fusion energy." The prudent leadership that this Committee has 
long provided in the fusion area will be particularly valuable in 
encouraging the science community to reach a speedy resolution of 
its present puzzles and to apply the resultant lessons for the 
advancement of fusion research. 


In my testimony, I will try to 

outline the present status of the process of experimental 
.verification of "cold fusion" and will comment very briefly on the 
potential for practical applications. 

Two distinct types of experimental data have been cited as 
evidence for the existence of "cold fusion": (1) calorimetric data 
involving unexplained heat releases at levels of about one watt or 
more; (2) a variety of nuclear-physics data, such as unexplained 
levels of nuclear radiation or tritium concentration, corresponding 
to fusion-energy releases in the range 10 -12  - 10 -  ' watts --
typically at least one billion times smaller than would be required 
to account for the calorimetric "excess heat". Because of the vast 
shortfall in the magnitude of the observed nuclear phenomena, they 
cannot be used as experimental proof of the "cold fusion" 
interpretation of "excess heat"; on the other hand, even a 
demonstration of the complete absence of observable nuclear 
phenomena would not constitute a clear-cut disproof, since the 
possible existence of new radiation-free D-D fusion reaction modes 
is still under theoretical debate. 


Amore definitive experimental approach, currently in progress 

at a number of laboratories, is to search for traces of the D-D 
reaction products helium 4 and helium 3 (as well as continuing the 
search for tritium). As in the case of the nuclear-radiation 
measurements, the proof of the "cold fusion" hypothesis depends on 


establishing a quantitative correspondence between the measured 

concentration of helium atoms and the associated "excess heat" 
production. The helium measurement allows much more effective 
discrimination against the natural background, because the observed 
helium concentration should be cumulative -- increasing in 
proportion to the reaction time and the level of "excess-heating" 
power. Since there is little hope for a theoretical model that 
accounts for deuterium-fueled fusion power without any production 
of helium (or tritium), failure to observe the appropriate 
accumulation rates would constitute a clear-cut disproof of the 
"cold fusion" interpretation of "excess heat." 


While awaiting the results of sensitive helium-accumulation 

studies, experimental groups that have observed the "excess heat" 
phenomenon should be able to obtain significant additional evidence 


A1U 

by simple calorimetric means, If "excess heat" is being found 


during the electrolysis of hea

vy water (D20), the most obvious 

control experiment is to repeat the same electrolytic procedures 
using ordinary light water (H2 0). If "excess heat" continues to 
be observed, the "cold fusion" interpretation can still be 
maintained by invoking H-D fusion reactions between hydrogen and 
"background deuterium" -- such as the natural deuterium content in 
light water (about one part in 6000). In that case, the decisive 
control experiment would be to mix small quantities of heavy water 
into the light water: The "excess heat" from H-D reactions should 
be observed to rise proportionately as the fraction of heavy water 
is increased. 

When carrying out light-water control experiments, it is 
important to keep in mind that gross differences in chemical 
behavior are known to characterize the electrolysis of heavy and 
light water: These differences have been exploited on an 
industrial scale for the separation of heavy water from light 
water. Provided that the control experiment addresies itself 
specifically to the comparison of "excess heats" (rather than to 
the comparison of gross electrolytic heating effects) a systematic 
finding of large "excess heat" in heavy-water experiments and "no 
excess heat" in the light-water control experiments would provide 
a significantly encouraging sign in favor of the "cold fusion" 
hypothesis. 

The documentation of calorimetric results pointing towards a 
nuclear energy source would further stimulate the search for the 
responsible nuclear mechanism. On the other hand, the emergence 
of a non-nuclear explanation of calorimetric "excess heat" would 
not rule out the "cold fusion" interpretation of the much smaller 
unexplained energy releases being projected by some of the 


experimental groups that are currently studying nuclear-physics 

phenomena in electrolytic and non-electrolytic systems. The 

accompanying versions of "cold fusion" theory invoke only the 
previously known D-D fusion reactions, so that "excess heat" of 
calorimetrically measurable magnitudes would not be expected in the 
first place. 

To test the reality of the "cold fusion" interpretation of 
nuclear-physics phenomena, a. number of control experiments would 
be helpful: (1) In the case of deuterium-based experiments, verify 
whether the observed neutron counts can be identified With the 
characteristic 2.45-MeV fusion neutron emission -- at levels that 
are decisively above the radiation background. (2) Carry out the 


appropriate control experiments, using hydrogen. (3) Investigate 

hydrogen-deuterium mixtures, look for the characteristic 5.5-MeV 

gamma-ray emission of the H-D reaction, and compare its magnitude 
with that of the D-D neutron emission. 

During the past month, the Princeton Plasma Physics 


Laboratory, in collaboration with Electron Transfer Technologies 

of Princeton, New Jersey, has sought to reproduce both the 
calorimetric and nuclear D-D experiments and has initiated a modest 
experimental research effort directed along the lines of item (3) 
above. A fundamental physics motivation for the latter experiments 
'is that the observation of H-D reactions would be more clearly 


indicative of quantUmmechanical tunnelling than the observation 

of D-D reactions, and would therefore provide a more direct test 
of "cold fusion" theory. 


Historical experience with the explOitation of scientific 

breakthroughs shows that the most useful applications are seldom 
recognized from the outset. Considering that the very existence 
of "cold fusion" remains uncertain at this point, comments on 
possible practical applications can clearly take only a very 
general form. 

If the calorimetric "excess heat" is found to be of nuclear 
origin, the billionfold shortfall of nuclear radiation, which is 
currently a disappointment,to experimentalists, could turn into an 
asset: The production of radioactive by-products of fusion energy 
would be further reduced relative to the fission alternative. On 
the other hand, the conversion of "cold fusion" heat releases into 
useful energy might present problems of thermodynamic efficienCy. 

In any case, it is worth noting that the advantage of small 
physical size, which is currently helpful in carrying out low-
powered "cold fusion" experiments, is unlikely to project to 


correspondingly small-sized future power plants; since physical 

size is correlated with power-handling capability, somewhat 

independent of the nature of the energy source. 


Summary 

Experiments decisively proving or disproving the reality of 
"cold fusion energy" remain to be done.' 
"excess heating" (about one watt or more) can be pursUed by simple 


control experiments using light-water or light-water/heavy-water 

mixtures, or (most definitively) measuring the accumulation of 
helium. 

The explanation of nuclear "cold fusion" phenomena (with 
implied energy releases in the range 10 -12  - 10 -8  watts) needs to 
be pursued by means of more powerful nuclear-radiation diagnOsiics, 
along with control experiments using deuterium-hydrogen tiktures. 

In our present state of knoWledge, the practical potential of 
"cold fusion" cannot he assessed, but the emergence of such a 
remarkable new phenomenon of physiCswould clearly be exciting and 
promising. 

Over the years, this Committee his played a leading role in 


• 

fostering fusion-energy research and public awareness of the 
potential benefits of fusion as an environmentally benign, 
inexhaustible energy source. Whateirer the immediate resolution may 
be concerning the reality and utility of."cold fusion energy," some 
progress may have been made during the past montkin focussing the 
world's attention on the potential value of a realistic long-tert 
strategy for the achievement of the fuSion7energy goal. 


The explanation of calorimetrically measurable levels of 

1. The members of this Committee would appreciate learning of your views 
concerning future funding support for fusion energy R&D programs - 
especially do you foresee a significant shift in emphasis from one 
area, such as magnetic confinement programs, to other approaches. 

In response to this general question, I should like to begin with 
specific comments on the relationship between magnetic confinement research 
and" "cold fusion" research. Since the time of the Committee's April 26, 
1989 hearing, the trend of the experimental evidence has been unfavorable 
to the interpretation of calorimetrically observed "excess heat" in terms 
of "cold fusion energy." A number of powerfully instrumented experimental 
studies -- including one at Harwell that received advice and materials from 
Professor Fleischman -- have yielded negative results. Radiation experts 
have challenged the reality of the "fusion neutron" emissions that had been 
reported to accompany the "excess heat" phenomenon. Chemists have pointed 
out that electrochemical energy-storage mechanisms plus ambiguities in 
calorimetric technique have the potential to account for the various types 
of "excess heat" phenomena that have been reported. In response, the 
proponents of "cold fusion" should be encouraged to improve their case by 
permitting open inspection of experimental apparatus, procedures, and 
results, particularly in the area of helium "ash" accumulation. Until some 
sort of positive experimental results are produced, however, there seems to 
be no basis for associating the finding of "excess heat" with the quest for 
nuclear fusion energy. 

Responding more generally to the Committee's question, I should like 
to note that very strong progress is currently being made in the 
understanding of magnetic confinement physics and in the achievement of 
reactorlike magnetic confinement objectives. As members of the Committee 
have already pointed out, the productivity of magnetic fusion could be 
further enhanced by making full use of existing experimental facilities and 
accelerating the construction of the major next-generation research device, 
the CIT. Continued reprogramming of funds from the magnetic-confinement 
effort into other areas is likely to have a significantly damaging net 
effect on the strength of the U.S. fusion effort.

Dr. Ballinger, please proceed. 

STATEMENT OF DR. RONALD G. BALLINGER, DEPARTMENT OF 
NUCLEAR ENGINEERING, DEPARTMENT OF MATERIALS SCI-


ENCE AND ENGINEERING, MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF 

TECHNOLOGY, CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS 

Dr. BALLINGER. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and members of 
this committee for the opportunity to come and make what will be 
the last comments, I believe. Since most of what I have to say has 
already been said quite forcefully, I think I will just probably try to 
conclude. 

I should say first that I'm just one member of a team at MIT 
that includes people from the Plasma Fusion Center, the director 
of which is Ron Parker, who I'm sure you're familiar with, and the 
Department of Chemistry, and the head of that department, Mark 
Wrighton, is also somebody who I'm fairly sure you're familiar 
with, and that the team contains many members. The list of those 
members is in the back of my testimony. But the point is the team 
is composed of experts in the fields of physics, plasma physics, 
chemistry, electrochemistry, radiation detection, and all of the dis-
ciplines which we feel are essential in the verification of the Uni-
versity of Utah results. 

Since the reports of these results, a number of— 
Mrs. LLOYD. Excuse me, Dr. Ballinger. We have a vote. Although 
we have five minutes, before you get into your testimony, I think it 
might be prudent that we vote and then we'll be back as soon as 
we possibly can to resume your testimony. 
[Whereupon, the committee was in recess.] 
Mrs. LLOYD. We will resume our hearing. Dr. Ballinger, you may 
proceed with your testimony. 

Dr. BALLINGER. I'm afraid, if we have another vote, that I'll be 
the only person here. The subcommittee is down to one. 

Mrs. LLOYD. It does happen at the end of the day. 

Dr. BALLINGER. I'll just continue where I left off. 

Since the reports of these results, a number of teams around the 
world have been working, to say the least, at a feverish pace to try 
to duplicate the results. To my knowledge, however, with the possi-
ble exception of the people at Stanford, and in Europe and the 
USSR, which I have no personal knowledge, we have not had a 
single confirmation, scientific confirmation of either the reported 
neutron emissions from the experiment, nor the excess heat. I want 
to be careful when I say scientifically verified. 

This is in spite of the fact that—at MIT, we are in that category, 
I should say. This is in spite of the fact that we and others are em-
ploying methods of radiation detection which are at least ten times 
more sensitive than the University of Utah experiments, and calor-
imetry, which is on the same order, probably ten times more sensi-
tive than has been used originally. 

In the scientific community, I should say that the soundness of 
experimental or theoretical research results—and I'm not saying 
anything new here—they're evaluated through peer review. For re-
sults such as those reported, whose potential impact on the scientif- 
is community and the world are so great, this review is absolutely 
essential. Unfortunately, for reasons which are not clear to me, 
this has not happened in this case, at least so far. The level of 
detail concerning the experimental procedures, conditions and re-
sults necessary for verification of the experiments at the Universi-
ty of Utah have not been forthcoming. At the same time, we've 
seen almost daily articles in the press, often conflicting with the 
facts, and they have raised public expectations, possibly for naught, 
that the energy problem has been solved. I think those of you who 
are as old as I am remember the "too cheap to meter" statement 
that was made about another source of energy not too long ago. 

And so we in the scientific community are left to attempt to repro-
duce or verify a potentially major scientific breakthrough while 
getting the experimental details from the Wall Street Journal. 

I'm not singling out that publication. It happens to be the one 
that I read in the morning. I'm from Boston, and The Globe is 
probably here. 

Experiments like this, which are conducted in haste on insuffi-
cient detail, coupled with premature release of results, have often 
resulted in retractions and embarrassment on the part of the scien-
tific community. I guess we're all human. 

The result of this unsatisfactory situation has been that a 
healthy skepticism and in some cases a distrust of the reported re-
sults has developed. We at MIT share this skepticism. 

At the risk of becoming a bit too technical by my comments, I 
think I should comment a little bit on the source of at least our 
skepticism. As I mentioned earlier, the major results reported by 
the University of Utah are that there have been a generation of 
excess heat and the measurement of neutron radiation. By excess 
heat I mean—and I'm sure we're all aware by the end of the day—
that there's been a measurement of more energy produced than 
has been input to the system. 

From our standpoint, the key point of verification is the detec-
tion of neutron radiation. This has been reported in their published 
paper. From an engineering point of view, however, the important 
of excess heat is the critical component. On these two critical 
points, we have found that the results reported in the few available 
published documents are inconclusive or unclear. 

For example, with respect to the detection of neutrons, the re-
ported results are confusing. They either do not agree with or are 
not presented completely enough to show that they are consistent 
with what one would expect from the emission of neutrons from 
the deuterium fusion reaction. The gamma ray spectrum that is re-
ported in the paper does not have the shape and intensity that 
demonstrates the increase in the number of detected neutrons 
above what's normal background. Further, the reported rate of 
neutron emission and level of tritium production are consistent 
with natural background. The results have, nevertheless, been re-
ported as significant. These inconsistencies can only be resolved by 
a full disclosure of the details of the experimental measurement for 
examination by the scientific community. Until such time as this 
occurs, we feel that the data is really insufficient to demonstrate 
the presence of neutrons. 


loy 

In conclusion, I feel that it's safe to say that the scientific com-
munity is excited, very excited, about the possibility of a significant 
advance in this area. From my standpoint as an electrochemist, it's 
one of the few times I've started talking to the physicists. It's a 
very, very, very welcome and it's an exciting topic. But it is, at the 
same time, skeptical of the results that have not been verified and 
frustrated by the methods by which the discovery has been han-
dled, both in the scientific and nonscientific community. 

Thank you.

Comments on "Cold Fusion" 


Testimony presented to 

Committee on Science, Space, and Technology 

U.S. House of Representatives 

Washington, D. C. 


by 

Professor Ronald G. Ballinger 

Department of Nuclear Engineering 

Department of Materials Science and Engineering 

Massachusetts Institute of Technology 

Cambridge, Massachusetts 

April 26, 1989 

Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee: 
I am Ronald Ballinger, a faculty member of the Departments of 
Nuclear Engineering and Materials. Science and Engineering at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I am very grateful for your 
invitation to convey my views related to the recent reports of the 
achievement of "cold fusion". 

I am a member of an interdisciplinary team at MIT that is 
involved in an attempt to reproduce the reported "Cold Fusion" 
results of Professors Pons and Fleischmann of the University of Utah. 

The teams' principals include Dr. Ronald R. Parker, Director of M1T's 
Plasma Fusion Center; Professor Mark S. Wrighton, Head of the 
Chemistry Department; and myself. (A complete list of team 
members and areas of expertise is included). The team is composed 
of experts in the fields of physical metallurgy, electrochemistry, 
plasma physics, instrumentation, and radiation detection. The team 
has been involved in attempts to reproduce the results, reported by 
Professors Pons and Fleischmann since shortly after their results 
were released to the press and for publication in the Journal of 
Electroanalytical Chemistry. 

As I am sure that you and the members of this committee are 
aware, any breakthrough in the area of energy production that has 
the potential to supply current and future energy needs in a non 
polluting manner must be given serious attention. Quite apart from 
its impact on basic science, the results recently reported by 
Professors Pons and Fleischmann, should they prove to be correct, 


Lao 

represent such a breakthrough. The basic nature of their results 
have been described and discussed by earlier testimony before this 
committee. Basically, the team at the University of Utah has 
reported the fusion of Deuterium atoms in a palladium matrix at 
MOM temperature. 

As evidence that "cold fusion" has taken place the production of 
excess heat and neutron radiation has been reported. The reported 
magnitude of both of these is such that their presence could be 


verified by other investigators. • • 

Much more modest results have been reported by a team of 
Investigators at Brigham Young University. We feel that it is 
important to distinguish between the BYU results, which are of 
teientific interest but of limited or no practical significance and those 
A the University of Utah which, should they prove correct have 
najor implications for future energy production. 

Since the reports of these results, a number of teams 
worldwide have been attempting to reproduce these results. To my 
cnowledge, with the possible exception of the Stanford results and 
esults from Europe and the USSR of which I have no personal 
mowledge, no team has been successful. As far as the results of 
ttempts by the team at MIT are concerned, we have been thus far 
mable to scientifically verify any of these results. This is in spite of 
he fact that we are employing calorimitry and radiation detection 
lethods of even greater sophistication and sensitivity than those of 
he University of Utah. Having said this I can assure you that these 
negative results have not been the results of a lack of effort. The 
MIT team has been, as I am sure is the case with other teams, 
laboring around the clock. However, we and the other teams have 
been handicapped by a lack of enough scientific detail to guarantee 
that we are actually duplicating these experiments. 

In the scientific community the soundness of experimental or 
theoretical research results is evaluated through peer review and 
duplication. For results such as those reported, whose potential 
impact on the scientific community and the world are so great, this 
review process is absolutely essential. Unfortunately, for reasons 
that are not clear to me, this has not happened in this case - at least 
so far. The level of detail concerning the experimental procedures, 
conditions and results necessary for verification of the Pons and 
Fleischmann results have not been forthcoming. At the same time, 
almost daily articles in the press, often in conflict with the facts, have 
raised the public expectations, possibly for naught, that our energy 
problem has been "solved". We have heard the phrase "too cheap to 
meter" applied to other forms of electric energy production before. 

And so the scientific community has been left to attempt to 
reproduce and verify a potentially major scientific breakthrough 
while getting its experimental details from the Wall Street Journal 
and other news publications. 

Experiments conducted in haste and based on insufficient detail 
coupled with premature release of results have often resulted in 
retractions and embarrassment on the part of the scientific 
community - caught in the heat of the moment. I guess we are all 
human. 

The result of this unsatisfactory situation has been that a 
healthy skepticism and, in some cases, distrust of the reported 
results has developed. We at MIT share this skepticism. 

At the risk of becoming too technical in my comments, I feel 
that I must be a bit more specific with regard to the source of this 
skepticism. As I mentioned earlier the major results, reported by 
the University of Utah group are that there has been a generation of 
excess heat and the measurement of neutron radiation. By excess 
heat I mean that there has been a measurement of more energy 
produced than has been supplied to the system. From our standpoint 
the key, from a verification point of view, is the detection of neutron 
radiation. From an engineering point of view, however, the 
importance of excess heat production is critical. On these two critical 
points we have found that the results reported in the few available 
published documents from the University of Utah are inconclusive or 
unclear. For example, with respect to the detection of neutrons, 
critical products of the fusion reaction, the reported results are 
confusing. They either do not agree with or are not presented 
completely enough to show that they are consistent with what one 
would expect from the emission of neutrons from the deuteriutn 
fusion reaction. Specifically, the reported y-ray spectrum produced 
by neutron emission does not exhibit a shape and intensity that 
demonstrates an increase in the number of detected neutrons above 
normal background. Further, the reported rate of neutron emission 


Leo 

and level of tritium production are consistent with natural 
background. The results have nevertheless been reported as 
"significant". Those inconsistencies can only be resolved by a full 
disclosure of the details of the experimental measurements for 
examination by the scientific community. Until such time as this 
occurs we feel that the data is insufficient to demonstrate the 
presence of neutrons. 

As far as the issue of excess energy is concerned we are also 
faced with a confusing situation. While the presence, of excess 
energy is documented in the Journal of Analytical Electrochemistry 
paper, the method by which this excess energy was determined is 
not clear. With metals, such as palladium, which act as , hydrogen 
storage media and at the same time as catalysts for many chemical 
reactions, both situations which can result in discontinuous chemical. 
energy releases, it is critical that a total energy balance over time be 
done. To us it is not clear that this has been the case. Until this issue 
is clarified we are unable to make a judgement concerning the excess 
energy issue. 

In conclusion I feel that it is safe to say that the scientific 
community is (1) excited about , the possibility of a significant 
advance in the area of fusion energy research, (2) but is, at the same 
time, skeptical of results that have not been verified to this point and 
(3) is very frustrated at the methods by which the discovery has 
been handled both in the scientific and non-scientific community. 

Thank you.

DISCUSSION 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you very much, Dr. Ballinger, as well as Dr. 

Furth. 

You're researchers as well as members of faculties. What is the 
attitude among the nuclear engineering and the physics students 
towards these new developments at your institutions? 

Dr. BALLINGER. I can tell you that within two hours of the re-
ported results from Utah, a number of graduate students, primari-
ly from the chemistry department at MIT, were high-tailing it over 
to the plasma fusion center to find a place to do these experiments. 

Those folks have been working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 
for the last month. So the excitement on the part of the graduate 
students is extreme. That's an understatement, also. 

I should say also that the excitement on the part of the faculty is 
also very much there. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Of course, the main comment that you made, there 
has been no indication to indicate a deuterium fusion reaction. It's 
my understanding that most of this work has been done at relative-
ly high energies and there's really no work to measure this rate at 
lower energies, at room temperature. So are there any characteris-
tics of reaction at these low temperatures which might explain the 
fact that the measurements to date have not seen the large flux of 


neutrons? Could this be— 

Dr. FURTH. Maybe I cold comment on that. 

We are fortunate to have the experiment in new meson fusion, 
which is cold fusion certainly, which were mentioned by Dr. Jones 
a little while ago. That's about as cold as you can get. And in that 


case the deuterium-deuterium fusion reaction was perfectly 

normal, gave rise to exactly the product suspected, just as it does in 
so-called warm fusion. So it is not the coldness of the fusion that is 
changing the basic process of nuclear fusion here, if, indeed, it is 
being changed. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Then the answer to my question is a big no. 

Dr. FURTH. I'm sorry? 

Mrs. LLOYD. The answer to my question is a big no, that this 
would not account for the fact that we have not seen the large 
fluxes of neutrons? 

Dr. FURTH. That's right. What is being cited as the explanation is 
not the coldness but the presence of the palladium-titanium metal 
lattice, and the idea is that somehow that can interact with this d-d 
fusion process in such a way as to carry off the excess energy. But 
someone has compared this to setting off a hand grenade in a hay-
loft and expecting the hay to change the nature of the hand gre-
nade explosion. People are having trouble seeing how this would 
work. 

Mrs. LLOYD. At this point, would you characterize this then as a 
chemical reaction? 

Dr. FURTH. I really can't tell what it is yet, because the experi-
mental evidence that has been laid on the table simply is insuffi-
cient to be persuasive. My feeling, therefore, is I would like to urge 
vigorously both that more experiments be done and that more evi-
dence, if it already exists, should be laid on the table so we can see 
it. 

Mrs. LLOYD. What sort of peer review activities would you like to 
see? 

Dr. FuRm. I think that one of the most productive activities at 
the moment is the collaboration of Utah U. with Los Alamos, and 
perhaps with other places, in the collaboration of Brigham Young 
with Los Alamos and perhaps other places, because one can get 
only so wise from reading articles, let alone from reading the daily 
press. The thing to do is to have the observers of these phenomena 
physically transport their palladium rods and their apparatuses 
into the environment of these large laboratories where really care-
ful measurements can be made. I think that really would be a very 
effective way for the peers to get mixed in with the originators of 
these ideas. 

A second point is I look forward very much to this meeting at 
the end of May in Santa Fe, where all the cold fusion optimists and 
skeptics will gather and thrash it out for an extended period. I 
think that should be very productive. 

Mrs. LLOYD. But at this point, you characterize your response as 
wait and see? 

Dr. FURTH. Yes. I would say, since I haven't seen anything that 
is truly persuasive, that truly proves the point, therefore, my atti-
tude is to wait and see. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Dr. Ballinger, does this characterize your philosophy 
at this point? 

Dr. BALLINGER. Yes. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Does the Stanford experiment meet the plain water 
or the heavy water test, Dr. Furth? 

Dr. Fula& We don't know yet. It again is a matter of seeing the 
particulars, and I wish I could fly off to San Diego to be there to-
night and hear about it. But there will be many good people who 
will scrutinize what Dr. Huggins has to say and we 11 see. 

I have so far, in response to my mentioning this control experi-
ment with light water in Dallas, have gotten at least three differ-
ent inputs; namely, Professor Huggins sees heavy water heating 
and not light water. There's another professor from Drexel who 
sees light water heating but not heavy water, and there's a lot of 
people who don't see either one producing more heat than it 
should. So I'm in a state of confusion. 

As I mentioned earlier, I sort of have the feeling, when I hear 
Dr. Fleischmann say that he'd rather not talk about light water 
fusion, that there is something there that he's not talking about, 
and I wouldn't be surprised if he's wiser than any of us about what 
happens and look forward to some time when his patent attorneys 
or whoever will let him talk about it. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you very much. 

Mr. Schiff. 

Mr. SCHIFF. Thank you, Madam Chair. 

Gentlemen, I don't want to belabor a previous set of questions I 
asked, but again, I think you're aware we're between being advised 
to make a great investment into this type of research that's done 
at the University of Utah, and what I think you referred to, Dr. 

Ballinger, as a heavy skepticism. The problem for us is which way 
to go. We're advised, on the one hand, that we should move imme-
diately before other nations take advantage of the commercial and 
scientific applicability of this process, and we're advised that going 
too far too fast in one direction could backfire on us. 

So I would be grateful simply for your opinion. If you were us, 
what would you do now? 

Dr. Fuwrii. Do you want to speak first? 

Dr. BALLINGER. I think if I were you, I would try to find a way to 
provide the kind of funding that people that have very innovative 
ideas—and I think this is one of them and must, so far at least, can 
do something quickly to either prove or disprove a particular 
theory, but that that freedom should only go so far. There needs to 
be technical, scientific verification of the results before you make a 
major commitment of funds. 

I think that once you get verification, that there is a very serious 
problem in this country about the way we get things, in effect, to 
market. So I think that a lot of the points made by earlier speakers 
are very, very valid. 

I, for one, have not had a problem in getting the amount of funds 
that I need to do what one would consider to be "offbeat" or wild 
type of experiments, so I haven't had the experience that other 
people have. But I've certainly heard people talk about it. 

Dr. Fuirm. If I could comment, also, I very much sympathize 
with the idea that you don't want the situation where something 
good has been discovered scientifically and it runs on for months 
and years on end, as one polishes up the scientific theory, and one 
lets technological opportunity slip by. So certainly, I totally agree 
those should be telescoped. 

But I think, before you launch on anything ambitious, you really 
should know whether it's for real or not. And in this case, you 
don't know it. I don't know it; maybe nobody knows it. This could 
lead to a very severe embarrassment, and from seen from a scien-
tific point of view, the scientific community is not thrilled at con-
templating that, and I would think the Congress would not, either. 

So I think prudence dictates that if you wish to accelerate the proc-
ess, what you would do is really turn on the screws on this verifica-
tion business, and whatever money is lacking, I'm sure it can be 
found to get on with it. 

It isn't even very expensive,, nor need it take very long. As I 
mentioned in my testimony, things you could do would only take a 
week. So I think there is where the pressure belongs. The business 
of making big commitments to things, to projects which are based 
on phenomena which we don't know yet to be real, I think that 
isn't speediness; that is haste. 

Mr. SCHIFF. Of course, the testimony of the second panel was 
that in other countries they're willing to take that gamble, and I 
know if I sound like I'm contradicting myself, it's because we're 
hearing up here contradictory advice. 

The consultant to the University of Utah has stated, or at least 
implied, that in Japan, at least, after reading a newspaper article, 
they were all set to invest a significant amount of assets into this 
research now.. 

Dr. Ftrirrx. Yes. 

Mr. SCHIFF. Do you believe that is, in fact, occurring, if you 
know, Dr. Furth? 

Dr. FURTH. I'm sure your means of discovering this are better 
than mine. I have no idea. And rm sure your judgment as to 
whether that's wise or no and whether we should imitate it, is 
also very good. And so me just rest with my description of how I 
see the fact. 

Mr. &imp. I can only hope that we politicians ultimately come 
to the right conclusion for this ociontific community. 

Thank you, Madam Chair. 

Mrs. LLOYD. Thank you very much, Mr. Schiff. 

I want to thank the witnesses for being here, the participants. 

This has been a long hearing, but its been a good hearing. 

I would also like to thank the staff for the excellent manner in 
which they put our hearing together. To all of you, I express my 
appreciation.

"COLD FUSION" 
Many of us were surprised at the recent 


announcement by Doctors Pons and Fleischmann that 

they had discovered "cold fusion" in their 

laboratory at the University of Utah. 

I know that many of my constituents have expressed 
both confusion and amazement at this development, still 
unsure of its implications or what it actually means for 
science and scientific development. I was pleased that 


the subcommittee on Energy, Reserch and Development 

recently redirected $5 million into the Basic Energy 
Sciences program to study cold fusion. 

Certainly, the importance of such a discovery if 


confirmed would have great implications for energy 

resources in the United States. I look forward to 
hearing the testimony knowing that we could be on the 
brink of a new development in scientific technology.

Summary 

Recent claims of electrochemically-induced fusion and the production of 
large amounts of excess heat in a simple palladium/heavy water/platinum 
cell have triggered world-wide efforts to confirm the claims. If either 
claim is confirmed, new approaches to fusion and/or energy production 
will be possible. This could change the energy R&D plans for the United 
States. The essential next step is confirmation (or refutation) of the 
reports. This may require several months of effort. 

Thank you for the opportunity, to provide written testimony on the sub-
ject of electrochemically-induced cold fusion. I am Elton J. Cairns, 
Director of the Applied Science Division of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory 
(LBL), Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of California 
at Berkeley, and President-elect of the Electrochemical Society. This 
testimony represents my own views, and does not necessarily represent 
those of LBL, the University of California, or the Electrochemical 
Society. 

Since the announcement of electrochemically-induced cold fusion by Pons 
and Fleischmann (at the University of Utah) on March 23, 1989, the 
scientific community has been attempting to learn more about the experi-
ments behind this remarkable claim, and the related work by Jones and 
coworkers (at Brigham Young University.) Both groups have used very 
simple electrochemical cells comprised of a palladium or titanium elec-
trode, a platinum electrode, and a heavy-water electrolyte (D 20). Pal-
ladium and titanium have a special capacity for absorbing large amounts 
of deuterium, which is produced electrochemically in the cell from the 
D20. The fusion reaction is said to occur in the deuterium-containing 
palladium or titanium electrode. Preprints of the Fleischmann and Pons 


paper 

(J. 

Electroanal. Chem. 


301 (1989)), and the Jones et al 

paper (submitted to Nature) have been made available to the scientific 
community. Basically there are two types of claims: 


Evidence of nuclear fusion reactions 

d + d 

3He + n 

d +d—t+ p 

Both of the above groups claim to see evidence of nuclear fusion 
reactions through detection of neutrons and/or tritium. The 
rate of formation of the products of these reactions is very low 
(in the range of one pair of deuterons per second.) 
Evidence of large amounts of "excess" heat, which cannot be 
accounted for by any known chemistry (nuclear or otherwise.) 
This observation was reported by the Fleischmann-Pons group, but 
not by the Jones group. The rate'of heat release was reported 
to be three and more times the rate of energy input to the cell, 
" and at least a million times the rate. corresponding to the neu-
tron production. 

Many laboratories around the world have been seeking to confirm the two 
results listed above. Special sessions have been held at scientific 
meetings to learn more about the work and to discuss it. Some groups 
have reported confirmation of each of the above claims, but no details 
are available yet. Some of the earlier confirmations have already been 
retracted. All of this leads to great confusion and uncertainty about 
the scientific validity and reproducibility of the results. Essentially 
all of the National Laboratories are attempting to confirm the experi-
ments, but no confirmation has been announced. Experiments are underway 
at LBL, but no confirmation has been achieved yet. Part of our work at 
LBL is devoted to a careful energy balance, related to the second claim 
listed above. 

If either or both of the claims are conclusively verified, this would 
indicate a very important scientific achievement. If only the first 
claim is verified, this would constitute evidence for nuclear fusion in 
a crystal lattice under very mild conditions, compared to those used in 
the fusion research program. This fusion in a crystal lattice would 
open up a new approach to fusion research which could prove to be very 
important. There would be no immediate practical benefit from this 
result, however. 

If the second claim (large amounts of excess heat) is verified, then 
there could be much more near-term benefit. One would expect that inex-
pensive heat could be produced for many low-temperature applications, 
such as heating buildings, providing hot water, etc. If the excess heat 
could be produced at higher temperatures (as a result of additional 
research), then many more applications could prove feasible, such as the 
production of inexpensive electrical energy, and high-grade thermal 
energy for industrial processes. Since palladium is a precious metal 
(much like platinum), it probably is not feasible to rely on the use of 
palladium in large amounts. Therefore, research would be needed on the 
use of other deuterium-absorbing metals, such as titanium,
vanadium, 
iron, niobium, and others. 

With all of the claims, activity, and confusion, what should be done 
next? There should be careful, well-planned, complete experiments that 
have as their objective the confirmation of the two effects already 
claimed: (1) the fusion of deuterium in palladium to produce neutrons 
and/or tritium, and (ii) the production of significant amounts of excess 
heat (over and above the energy input and over and above the rate of 
neutron or tritium production). The planning and execution of such 
experiments are in progress. Once the claims have been verified, or 
properly refuted, then plans can be made to follow up on whatever posi-
tive results may emerge. 

It is still too early to have any idea of what the outcome will be. We 
should not alter the funding of existing energy R&D efforts yet. We 
should place a high priority on high-quality confirmation efforts. 

These efforts could require from one to several more months. If confir-
mation of deuterium fusion in palladium is achieved, we have a new 
approach to fusion research. If confirmation of the excess thermal 
energy is achieved, we have a new area of energy R&D to pursue, with 
possible near-term benefits. Either one of these is an exciting 
development, worthy of an appropriate federally-funded program. 

Thank you for the opportunity to submit my views to the Committee.

Hearing on Recent Developments in Elision Energy Research 


Te.t.Inutty An. lib. 11.....n.s1 

by 

Texas ABM University/Texas Engineering Experiment Station 

We appreciate the opportunity to submit written testimony for the record 
and emend Chairman Roe for the timeliness of this hearing. 

Tama AMMIkrlimrsity revs:wilier% have teen actively pursuing investizatinns 
of anomalous heat generation by electrochemical decompoettion of heavy water with 
palladium cathodes. Two research groups, using different calorimetric techniques, 
have shown that when heavy water is electrolyzed using a palladium cathode and a 
platinum anode, excess heat is generated. The rate of excess heat generation 
reached 15 W/cm3, which is comparable to the value reported by Pleisentan and 
Pons. Texas ABM University has also carried out the crucial experiments to con- 
firm that there is no excess heat generation with palladium in normal water nor 
with platinum in heavy water. Experiments performed with a unique precision micro-
calorimeter, which were continuously recorded on chart paper, showed for the first 
time, that palladium and heavy water are crucial for producing the excess heat. 

Experiments are in progress to determine the critical parameters that govern the 
excess heat generation. 

While we are yet at the threshold of recent scientific developments, it is 
important to keep in mind that once the press leaves the laboratories, the 


s

c

ientists will still be there doing research. In order for experimental data, 
such as we have now, to reach a stage when it can be called a technology; and 
then be able to apply that technology to practical energy use, a sustained 
commitment is necessary.

wish to admit written questions for the record, we would be happy to answer 
them.
