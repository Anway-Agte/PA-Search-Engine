1. Introduction

The assumption of a narrow nuclear energy level solves the puzzle of "excess heat" without
commensurate neutron and Gamma radiationl11
• This assumption is supported by the "heat after
death" and "heat after life" experiments; however, a question remains, i.e. how an extremely narrow
energy level is able to be in resonance with the narrow energy level of a lattice confined ion. A "fine
tuning" mechanism in terms of"self-lock" is proposed to solve this remaining problem.


2. Theoretical Expectation-"Fine Tuning" parameter.

The characteristic time in "heat after death" experiments (104 seconds), and the fact of "excess heat
without commensurate neutron radiation" have revealed a low energy resonance d-d state with an
energy width of 10"19eV. On the other hand, the lattice confined deuterons are distributed on the
energy band in the palladium lattice potential well. If the density of state in that energy band is
greater than Pc
(E) � 1019 /eV; then, the resonance penetration of Coulomb barrier would be more
probable since the energy band width in the palladium lattice may be greater than 1 meV. This
requirement on density of state turns out to be a requirement on the grain size in the Pd crystal: i.e.
the grain size should be greater than 50 ~ 100 microns.

However, the dynamics ofresonance requires more than a grain size. The extremely narrow energy
level may resonance with one of the energy levels in the lattice energy band, but the heat released in
this resonance may quickly push themselves away from the resonance due to the thermal expansion
which shifts the energy band. If we would like to keep them in resonance, there has to be a
restoring force to pull them back. The variation of
the density of state, p ( E) , may provide such a
restoring force, if dp( E) < 0 . (E is the energy ofthe relative motion of d-d state). In Fig.1 it shows

expansion lowers the energy band, the resonance

level in that energy band; hence, see a less density
of state. This difference in the density of state in an
energy band will reduce the heat released by the
resonance, and reduce the thermal expansion. In

other words, the negative derivative, dp( E)
< 0, will provide a negative feed-back to pull back the
dE
energy band and restore the resonance between the nuclear energy level, EN , and the lattice energy
level, EL . It is very similar to the "self-lock" phenomenon in ''fine tuning" mechanism of a radio
receiver.

There is a critical derivative of the density of state, ( '!:;) , in order to make this "fine tuning"
C work. Any power perturbation inside the calorimeter, !Sp, will result a thermal expansion,

Al kc system (0.1 ~ 0.7 WIK for most of"excess heat" experiments); a. is the linear expansion coefficient
(�l l .8x10-6 K"1 for palladium). The shift of the energy band due to this expansion is about
The energy band shift ML will change the number of resonance states from
p( EL )MN to p( EL + ML )MN . Here, MN is the width of the nuclear energy level. This change

This restoring power has to be greater than the initial power perturbation, !Sji , in absolute value but
opposite in their signs in order to keep this resonance. In other words, the derivative of the density
of the state has to be negative but its absolute value has to be greater than a critical value:
Since the density of the state in a Pd sample is proportional to its volume, V Pd ; it is evident that the
ratio of V pd to kc will determine the restoring force for the fine tuning mechanism. We may define
Va ( __!!_) as a "fine tuning" parameter

The greater the "fine tuning" parameter, F, is, the more stable the resonance between the nuclear
energy level and the lattice energy band, provided that the derivative of the density of the state less
than zero, i.e. 


3. Experimental Observation

The experiments have verified the first requirement ((pc(E) > 1019 eV-1) by the metallography of
the annealed Pd samplesC2l C3l and the positive annealing factl4l . Now we examine the ''fine tuning" 
parameter in various experiments. Table 1 lists some of these early positive "excess heat" 
experiments, and the recent negative experiment completed by Quickenden et a1_l5l.

Heat Transfer Coefficient Volume of Palladium 
It is noticed that in that negative experiment their "fine tuning" parameter is much less than those of 
all other positive experiments. Particularly, it is interesting to notice that the ''fine tuning" parameter 
in the early "negative" experiment of Lewis is relatively large, there should have been "excess heat" 
as pointed out by Dr. Miles in 1994. However, it was reported as a negative one. 

An important test on this ''fine tuning" mechanism is the sign of 
the derivative, dp . Although it is difficuh to calculate its exact 
dE 
number, it is possible to determine its sign according to the 
shape of the lattice potential well. The quantum mechanics gives 
the qualitative conclusion that the derivative of the density of 
state will be
as schematically shown in Fig.2. The inelastic neutron scattering 
Fig.2 Three types of well with 
different sign of dp/dE 
experiment showed that the lattice potential well in Pd is a square-well-like one because its 
anharmonicity parameter is positive (see Fukai [11]). 

Our gas-loading experiment provides an additional evidence on this ''fine tuning" mechanism. In 
Fig.3 , the upper line shows the temperature difference between the twin D/Pd and H/Pd systems 
and the lower curve shows the derivative of the temperature of 
the D/Pd system with respect to the time (in an enlarged scale), 
When the heating power through the tungsten wire is shut off: the 
temperatures of the twin systems are changing with the room 
temperature, but the temperature of the D/Pd system (T(D)) is 
always higher than that of H/Pd system due to the possible 
"excess heat" source in the D/Pd system. It is interesting to 
observe that this "excess heat" source changes in day and night 
also. The maximum of [T(D)-T(H)] appears at the point where 
T(D)-T(H) & dT(D)/dt 
the T(D) drops quickest, and the minimum of [T(D)-T(H)] appears at the point where T(D) rises 
quickest. This behavior implies a heat source in D/Pd system, which is proportional to 
(-dT(D)/dt ). A possible explanation of this behavior is just that the density of state in the resonance 
energy band decreases with the energy, i.e. dp < 0. When the T(D) is dropping, the D/Pd system 
dE 
will see a higher density of state in resonance. This is equivalent to adding an additional "heat 
source" into the D/Pd system. The quicker the T(D) drops, the stronger this additional "heat 
source", which enlarges the temperature difference between the D/Pd and H/Pd systems. 


4. Conclusion.


The ''fine tuning" mechanism supports the theory of penetration of the Coulomb barrier via lattice
confined ions, and the experiments support this "fine tuning" mechanism by three facts:
dp 
vpd 
p(E) > Pc(E),
and 
- > Fe .
dE 
kc 
A critical "fine tuning" parameter, �, is introduced to qualitatively describe this negative feed-back
for the "fine tuning" mechanism. In order to make the "excess heat" reproducible, it is important to
use large Pd sample (large V 
pd ), good insulation of calorimeter (less kc), suitable annealing to
increase the p(E), keep the square-well-like potential field in the Pd ( :; < 0) , and keep the high
population on that resonance energy level.
