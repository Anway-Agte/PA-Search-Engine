Introduction

The present study is based on the hypothesis that the main constraint to the obtainment of
high Hydrogen loading in palladium is the stress gradient due to the lattice expansion induced
by the hydride formation . During an experiment where H or D is diffusing into the Pd lattice
from the free surface, a stress gradient is generated by the solute concentration gradient
generated by the diffusion kinetics, owing to the increase of the lattice parameter from 3. 890 A
in pure palladium to 4. 094 A in Pd-H 1 [ 1]. It results, from experimental evidence and from a
theoretical analysis, that the presence of the stress field strongly affects the reaction kinetics
through the chemical potential at the sample surface The overall effect can stop the loading
reaction far from what one can expect only on the basis of chemical and thermodynamical
considerations [2,3,4).

In order to overcome such a limitation, essentially two strategies can be envisaged: (a) to
modify the loading dynamics avoiding the growth of an eccessive strain field during the
Hydrogen uptake [5], (b) to prepare a material with intrinsic characteristics such as to minimize
the solute concentration gradient and experimentally check if higher loading ratios can be
obtained for such material.

We have studied the influence of the concentration of short circuit paths ( dislocations and
grain boundaries) in the diffusive process. In fact, since the Hydrogen diffusion coefficient is
order of magnitude higher in the grain boundaries than in the bulk, by increasing the grain
boundary density ( i.e. small average grain size) the diffusive process can possibly take place in
two steps. Firstly, Hydrogen is incorporated in the grain boundary network where the
diffusivity is higher, permeating the material bulk without generating a substantial strain owing
to the small volume fraction involved. In a second step Hydrogen can be incorporated into the 
grain bulk by a diffusion process where the grain boundary acts as a source. So that the H or D 
concentration in the sample can be increased through a diffusion process where a large density 
of sources is present in the material. By comparison with the classical situation where the only 
source is represented by the sample free surface we can expect a noticeable reduction of the 
concentration gradient and of the associated stress field at the surface; we can so expect a faster 
kinetics and smaller effects on the chemical potential gradient which could allow the storage of 
a higher concentration of H into the Pd lattice. 

The same mechanism must be active in thin films enhanced by the low dimensionality. 
In a thin metallic layer we don't expect the growth of high stress fields because of the small 
volume involved, moreover the stress relief can be directed towards the substrate lattice in 
comparison not distorted. 


Experimental procedure 

Thermo-mechanical treatments and in particular cold working followed by thermal 
treatment have been used to induce different grain size in Pd samples, in order to study the 
effect of this microstructural feature on the capability to absorb hydrogen and its isotopes. 

Three different batches of Pd sheets were prepared by cold rolling the same foil 0.7 mm 
thick. The original foil was presumably in the annealed state. The samples were prepared by 
reducing the foil thickness from 0.700 to 0.450, 0.150 and 0.100 mm respectively. Small pieces 
of 16 x 5 mm cut from each foil, were annealed under vacuum (lo-6 Torr) at temperatures 
ranging from 800 °C to 1200 °C for 15 minutes, following the same temperature ramp. 

The resulting microstructure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, and in 
particular the grain size was measured on backscattered electron images showing channeling 
contrast. To this purpose the SEM was operated at 6 KV and an annular solid state 
backscattered electron detector was used. This procedure allows the measurement of the grain 
size without the need of metallographic etching, preserving so the surface for all the subsequent 
experiments. Each sample was electrolytically loaded with hydrogen or deuterium in a O. lM 
LiOH (D) solution using a maximum current of 100 mA (approx. 25 mA/cm2). The electrolysis 
time was limited to a few days (3 to 5 ) to avoid the excessive contamination of the cathode 
surface by impurities. Hydrogen content was measured " in situ" during the electrolysis by the 
electrical resistivity change with a method already described [5]. 

Pd films were thermally evaporated directly on Nickel substrate in 10-5 Torr vacuum after 
a soft (aceton) cleaning. The evaporation rate is quite high (10-20 Als) to improve the adhesion 
to the substrate.Thickness ranges from 1000 to 2000 A.The X-Ray Diffraction analysis allowed 
to study both the structure of the film and the substrate: from the spectra it is possible to 
obtain the average grain size and the residual stress of both. The grain size value was obtained 
using the Sherrer formula:which states a link between the peak (h,l, m) half height width and the 
average grain size along the (h,l,m) direction. We found grain size from 150 to 350 A.From the 
peak shift it is possible to obtain the uniform strain by differentiating the Bragg formula. 

Scanning Auger Microscopy and Secondary Electron Microscopy have been used to see 
that the Pd coverage on Ni is uniform. 
Nickel seems, at a glance, the best metallic substrate in Pd hydride preparation because Pd and 
Ni have both the fee structure; they both expand their lattice by dissolving n Hydrogen atoms 
in the volume V; the difference between strains can help in reducing the stress at the 
boundary between film and substrate. The relative volume change due to an atomic fraction 
c=n/N, where N are metal atoms, is !:,. VN=c(!:,.v/D.), where D. is the mean atomic volume of 
the metal atom and !:,.v is the additional volume needed to an interstitial. !:,.v/D. is related with 
the quantities used to describe the distortion field. 

The Nickel distortion field is higher than Palladium's at the same hydrogen concentration c: 
�v/0=0.28 for Ni and �v/0=0.19 for Pd., however hydrogen solubility is higher in Pd than in 
Ni, thus the thin Pd layer can rela"< its internal stress towards a lattice less distorted. 


Experimental results 

In fig. 1 , we report the grain size resulting from the thermal treatment of the samples 
submitted to different cold rolling as a function of the annealing temperature; three Pd batches 
were obtained from the same sample reducing its thickness (in origin 700 microns) by cold 
working. We obtained three series with different reductions: 450, 150 and 100 microns, the 
annealing time was always of 15 min. This time was selected after a preliminar set of tests in 
which the time was changed mantaining the same operative temperature. Longer time doesn't 
lead to significative changes. In agreement with the classical observations, the grain size 
depends both on the entity of cold working and on the temperature of thermal treatment, so 
that the same grain size can be obtained combining different temperatures and cold rolling 
procedures. In fig. 2 the grain size is related to the maximum hydrogen ( or deuterium) content 
reach�d during the electrolysis.

the maximum loading ratio achievable Samples were loaded in electrolysis at maximum 
current of 25 ma/cm2 

It must be underlined that, when recristallization occur, the grain size become 
comparable with the sample size, i.e. in the batch 450 µm thick we observed grain size 
greather than 300 µm. in such a case, the electrical resistance measurement tecnique used to 
evaluate the hydrogen concentration can be misleading due to the possible short circuit path 
among grains with different concentration, and then resistivity. The overall resulting resistivity 
can be, in principle, quite far from the mean value in the bulk. For the sake of semplicity we 
don't report here the measured loading ratios corresponding to grain size comparable with 
sample size 

It can be observed, for each value of thickness reduction by cold rolling, the presence of a 
maximum; a comparison with fig 1 shows that this occurs at about the same value of the grain 
size. We attribute this effect to the presence of two factors which enhance the H diffusion into 
the material and show an opposite trend with the grain size. In fact a smaller grain size will 
reduce the strength of the stress field at the sample surface since it can activate an unusual 
diffusion path in which the grain boundary network plays a leading role acting as a fast H (D) 
transporter trough the sample bulk . On the other hand the softening of the mechanical 
properties induced by a larger grain size can activate stress relief mechanisms based on the 
plastic deformation Traces of this effect can be found in the morphology of the sample surface 
after the H (D) charging procedure. 

A further effect, whose nature is still under investigation, can be evidenced by the 
comparison of micrographs taken before and after the H charging procedure. In fact. fig-I 
shows that the grain size after the electrolysis is enhanced, by a factor ranging from I. 5 to 2, 
relative to the same sample before electrolysis This shows that the sequence of metallurgical 
steps leading to the transformation from Pd to high concentration PdH(D) is very complicated 
and requires further investigation �[oreover the combination of all the effects we have reported 
in this short paper can easily explain the lack of reproducibility which is characteristic of this 
kind of experiments aiming to introduce a large amount of H or D onto the Pd lattice. 

FIG. 3 SEM pictures of the same sample before and after deuterium loading in electrolysis 
( max. loading ~ 0 9 D/Pd) The enhancement of grain size is a factor in between 1.5 and 2 
starting from a mean size of 50 microns. 

The investigation on thin films is just at the beginning, characterizations are in progress to 
qualify samples to be used in electrolysis. 

The Pd coating on Ni doesn't seem to affect the capability of adsorb deuterium, in fact, the 
R/R0 measured during the electrolysis versus the cell current shows a sligh increase in case of 
Ni plated with 1000 A of Pd.(see FIG4) It can be said that the Pd coverage on Ni surface 
doesn't affect the D adsorbtion.

Conclusions 

We have shown that the microstructure of the palladium and in particular its average grain 
size strongly affects its capability of absorbing Hydrogen: H concentration versus the average 
grain size shows a maximum for grain size of about 50 µm, which appears so to be the best 
value to obtain high loading ratios. On the basis of the afore mentioned considerations, the 
presence of a ma'<imum instead of the expected monotonic behaviour (the density of short 
circuit paths decreases monotonically with the average grain size increase) points to the 
presence of a second mechanism which enhances diffusivity for higher values of the grain size. 

In this picture the material microstructure affects in an effective way the H(D) distribution 
inside the sample during the charging experiment, as well as the Pd ability to stress relief by 
plastic deformations. It is well known that the mechanical properties of a material are enhanced 
by a small value of the average grain size as stated by the Hall-Petch relationships; a softer 
sample, with a coarse grain structure can then relax a stress field more easily by plastic 
deformation. We make the hypothesis that the combination of two mechanism, enhanced 
diffusivity through short circuit paths and stress relaxation by plastic deformation, is responsible 
for the-behaviour of Pd samples with different grain size, when submitted to H or D charging 
by electrolysis. 

On the other hand we have shown that the process is quite complex and not completely 
understood. Consequentely the lack of definition of the metallurgical parameters controlling the 
material behaviour in this kind of experiments, as well as a not sufficiently careful analysis of 
the material microstructure can be responsible of the well known problem of reproducibility of 
the heat excess experiments that requires high concentrations.We obtained, with satisfactory 
reproducibility, concentrations greather than 0.95 of Hydrogen and greather than 0.9 of 
Deuterium in palladium with samples of approximately 50 microns of grain size 
Also thin films can be used to improve the number of H(D) atoms per Pd atom; however, 
some technical problems as film adhesion to substrate and its behaviour in electrolysis must be 
yet solved.
