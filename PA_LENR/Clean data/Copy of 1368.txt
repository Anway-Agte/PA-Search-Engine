1. Introduction

As the mechanism of the cold fusion phenomena, the
fracto-fusion mechanism was proposed < 2
> < 4 >. In this
theory, a strong electric field generated by a crack in
the metal induces a local nuclear fusion. Failures in
the reproducibility of experimental results can be explained by this theory <3>
_ Recently, Arata and Zhang <1>
reported the positive results using a complex cathode
formed by plasma spraying, which contains plenty of
microscopic defects.

We adopted an alternating electrolysis, in which
charging and discharging of deuterons to the palladium
plate were repeated cyclically. This method is expected
to enhance the generation of cracks.


2. Methods

The neutron count rate was measured during the alternating electrolysis of D20 with Pd/Pt electrodes. Two
3He proportional counter tubes were used for the neutron
detector. In order to shield background neutrons, all
the electrolytical devices, 3He counters and water tanks
for neutron thermalization were coveted with cadmium
plate and set in a pile of water tanks, measured 1.Swx
1.2°x 2.3H (m). The efficiency of the neutron measurement was about 1.6%.

For the noise d iscrimination in the neutron
measurement, the wave form data of 3He amplifier output
was analyzed using wave form analysis. Neutron signals
were specified by the pulse height analysis.

The size of the Pd plate of 99.9% purity was 50x 12
x 0.1 (mm), which was surrounded by 4 turns of Pt wire
of 0.5 mm diameter. D20 solution of about 0.1 mol/1 LiOD
was used as the electro l yte. On e cycle of the
electrolysis consisted of 4 different stages, 2 hours
each, totaled 8 hours. Each stage was classified by
the Pd states of deuteron absorption, that is, Pd was CD
being charged, ® filled, ® being discharged and©
emptied with deuterons. Each stage was a constant current electrolysis with different current. It was CD 264
mA (22 mA/cm2), Pd negative, ® O mA, ® 104 mA (8.7
mA/cm2), Pd positive and© 0 mA, respectively. The D/Pd
ratio in the stage® was estimated about 0.77. It was
measured by discharging all the deuterons in the Pd
plate under the gas generating voltage.


3. Results

Hitherto, 4 Pd samples were examined. The results
of each sample are summarized in Table 1. The averaged
count rate of the sample 4 is decreased because of the
rearrangement of the apparatus. To make the difference
among the 4 stages clear, the accumulated differences of
neutron counts for each sample are shown in Fig.l. In
this figure, the difference from the stage© (emptied
state) are plotted. These data suggests an abnormal increase of neutron counts for the stages CD and® in
sample 1.


4. Discussion

Statistical analysis was executed f or these
results. Following the standard statistical procedure,
the difference of the averages was tested using tdistribution. In Fig.l, the 1% level of significance in
the one-sided t-test are plotted by the dash-dotted
line. It is indicated that the increase in the stage®
of sample 1 compared with the stage© is highly significant in 1% level of significance. It's power of test
is 90%. The 90% confidence interval of the neutron count
rate difference is estimated to be 0.8 ~ 3.2

counts/hour. This corresponds to 0.8x 10-
23~ 3.2x 10-2' fusions/deuteron pair/sec.

It is also indicated that the increase of the stagE
CD of sample 1 compared with the stage © is significan1
in 5% level of significance. In the stage CD, the effective charging is almost finished in the first 3C
minutes. Therefore, it is reasonable that the feature oi
the stages CD and @ is similar.

The analysis of variance was also applied to thE
results of sample 1. As a result, the homogeneity of thE
average count rate of each stage was denied with 2.5�
level of significance.

No significant difference was found outside the
neutron c haracteristic region of the pulse height
analysis. The number of counts in this region is toe
small to analyze with the same statistical precision.
But it confirms that the increase of the signal in the
stages CD and @ was due to neutrons, because the
pulse height spectrum as well as the wave shape corresponds to the characteristics of neutron signals.

In order to consider the influence of the atmospheric pressure on the background neutron count rate,
the average atmospheric pressure was compared for each
stage. No difference requiring further consideration was
recognized.

However, the reproducibility is not yet confirmed.
No significant difference was found in the experiment of
samples 2, 3 and 4. It cannot be denied that the data of
the sample 1 was obtained by chance. Therefore, further
experiment is required to confirm the cold fusion
phenomena.


5. Conclusions

Four Pd samples were tested with alternating D2O
electrolysis. One sample indicates highly significant
increase of neutron counts f or the deuteron filled
state. The level of significance is 1% in statistics.
The excess neutron count rate corresponds to the fusion
rate of 0.8x 10-23~ 3.2x 10-23 f usions/deuteron
pair/sec. Other samples indicate no significant
deference. Further experiments are necessary to confirm
the reproducibility.
