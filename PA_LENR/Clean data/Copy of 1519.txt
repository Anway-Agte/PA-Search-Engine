1 Introduction and Background 

The process of Technology Assessment (TA) is a tool which can be used to anticipate and 
mitigate negative impacts from the introduction of new technologies. The process of a 
Technology Assessment is more of an art than a science, but the overall goal of discovering the 
higher-order effects of technology is why Technology Assessment was created. One way of 
describing TA is to bring together researchers and policymakers.1 By linking these two groups 
of people together, there is the possibility to breach the divide which exists a wedge between 
progress and development in new areas of science and technology. Examining the process of 
conducting a TA will show the path for a way to examine the development of the technology in 
the LENR/CF field.  

Many have described TA as a type of systems analysis which would examine the impacts of a 
technology on society and various other metrics. But it also more than that, as Lee & Bereano 
state: “…the authors do not believe that a singular approach is possible…TA is neither merely 
forecasting nor futures research, neither social impact analysis nor purely system analysis. It 
goes beyond simply identifying the impacts and their causation.”2 The field of TA has shown 
that is possible for the government and scientists to find a place for a dialogue to exist which can 
showcase the higher order impacts of the introduction of new developments in science and 
technology. Since there is some variability as to what should even be included in a TA, different 
people have opined on what should be included. Sampling different TAs can give a taste of how 
different committees of people have answered the question of “What will this technology do to 
the society it is to be introduced to?”. Coates3 gives answer for how the Committee on Science 
and Public Policy answered what should the TA emphasize: “…the focal points of from which 
the assessment should begin…[are] the technology, the environment or the individual. Beginning 
with the focal point an assessment must consider both economic, social and legal arrangements 
which facilitate and use of a technology.”  
No matter the composition or areas of focus that the TA will cover, there are two things that all 
TAs should strive to achieve. The first is bounding the assessment. By setting the boundaries of 
what the assessment will cover, it allows for the project team to make progress toward the 
answers which they seek. Without bounding, the “…problem can be extended infinitely without 
method to limit the scope of the study.”2 The second attribute that the TA should attempt is to 
lay out policy alternatives. The effects of technology are most uncertain when the time horizon 
for introduction of the technology is a long way off. But policymakers do not want the 
researchers to make the decisions for them. It is necessary that society is informed of the policy 
alternatives are selected. Society will undergo changes with or without a TA completed on a 
given topic, but with the TA, society is illuminated to alternatives that can point it in an optimal 
direction.4 


2 Technology Assessment 

2.1 Purpose and Scope :
The TA should be organized in a way to focus the study on the impacts from the deployment of 
this type of technology. Maybe the way to structure alternatives would be to lay out the different 
types of technology and the materials in the reactions- i.e. the nickel vs. palladium or the type of 
scale that each type of company is proposing. The TA must find a way to focus the issues and list 
alternatives or put up the alternatives just to shoot them down. 

TA will require experts in many fields to be able to identify the numerous impacts that may 
occur, broad deployment will hit some areas of economy quicker and harder than others. Experts 
can outline what the likely areas will be.  

2.2 History  :
The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was created in 1972 as a passion project of 
Congressman Emilio Q. Daddario. The Congressman wanted a way to provide policymakers 
with a mechanism for policy research that would be able to respond to a world in which 
technology continues to be developed at a rapid pace. There was a need to categorize the 
potential positive effects of technology and give a methodology for integrating this technology 
into society. It was also necessary for predicting and offer mitigation strategies for the negative 
impacts.5 Since there was a lack of information about technology that was reaching 
policymakers, the final construction of the oversight board, Technology Assessment Board was 
made up of members of the House and Senate. The new agency, Office of Technology 
Assessment began its work and produced its first final TA in July of 1974. 

OTA completed many reports during its time in existence. For this project, there were five TAs 
that were related to energy and were evaluated for their applicability to the LENR/CF field.  
1. Energy from the West TA (Year) 
2. Coal Slurry Pipeline TA (Year) 
3. Coastal Offshore Energy Systems TA (Year) 
4. Energy Technology Choices TA (Year) 
5. Renewing Our Energy Future TA (1995) 
5 Guidebook for TA 

More in-depth summaries of the TA reports are presented in Appendix B. 

The first three reports all have the distinction of evaluating a specific technology or project in a 
certain spatial context. There are bound by geography and for number 2 and 3, they are bounded 
by specific technologies. The latter TAs are geared toward overall trends in energy and the 
energy mix choices for the country. The TA report for the LENR/CF case should be mainly 
broad like numbers 4 and 5 to bring about the most robust analysis. But since, LENR/TA is a 
specific technology choice, it is bounded similar to the reports which cover technologies. The 
project team should seek to follow the model which does not limit the spatial scope, but the 
technical one to cover LENR/CF in a proper way.  

2.3 Current Development and Participatory TA :
Though the OTA was defunded in 1995, the process of Technology Assessment did not 
completely disappear. In fact, it has thrived in Europe and also brought in laypeople to help with 
the analysis and policy for analyzing science and technology trends. In fact, there are about 12 
TA bodies in Europe including one in the European parliament. Scholars have pushed to 
reestablish Technology Assessment in the United States and to bring the public to the table when 
it comes to creating technology policy. Experts have recognized the valuable input that citizens 
can provide to science and technology policy. Within Europe, the best example of citizen 
engagement is the Danish style “consensus conference” which provides policy makers with a 
window into ordinary citizens’ opinions on technological developments by facilitating discussion 
about a particular topic and getting these stakeholders to participate in the policy making 
process.  

Since Participatory Technology Assessment (pTA) is focused on bringing citizens into the 
discussion, it would alleviate one of the biggest criticisms that were leveled at the OTA: no 
citizen perspective. While the OTA solicited outsider opinions on a regular basis, by far these 
people were concentrated in academia, industry and public-interest groups. The lay people were 
not brought into the process in a formalized way. Without the citizen, layperson involved in the 
TA process, the results will lack social values and specification of concerns of the public. With 
the knowledge base that a large sample of the general population can provide, the TA can 
assimilate broad understandings and other ideas that experts may overlook or underweight.6 
Policy development is enhanced when real-world citizens are included in the process rather than 
scientific decisions being made from the Ivory Tower. The legitimacy is improved with outreach 
and greater consensus on impacts from technology.  

The pTA can utilize 21st-century technology to reach many more people than a traditional expert-
only TA would. Social networks and transparent reporting can make for a robust process with 
many opinions of the average person taken into account.  

2.4 Importance of Evaluating Alternatives :
Since policy assessment is the main focus for TA, emphasizing the alternatives should be major 
focus of the report. An analysis which focuses on scenarios provides the greatest insight to where 
the technology could be headed and gives policymakers a firm grasp on the uncertainty which 
may exist in the choice of technology. Without a range of possibilities it is hard for people to 
understand where developments could be headed. The upper and lower bounds which the TA 
project team provides is a way for the TA to be valid and understandable by a wide range of 
people. A good model for scenario analysis is contained in Chapter 4 of the Energy Technology 
Choices TA. In that TA, there is a wide dispersion of possible outcomes and different weights 
associated with different impacts of the technology. A TA which can say that it covered the 
range of outcomes offers an unbiased diagnosis of the technology and can be a quality reference 
document for the policymakers in the United States. 

Without a focus on scenarios and their possible outcomes, the project team has only one 
opportunity to deliver its assessment to the policymakers. The incorporation of pTA within the 
scenario analysis offers a sensitivity analysis to conclusions that the project team will offer. 

2.5 Relevance of TA to/for? LENR/CF case :
Since there is a potential for a paradigm shift, LENR/CF is a great candidate for a TA. With a 
potential for a huge impact at the intersection of technology and society, there exists a need for 
an evaluation of the higher-order impacts from what the introduction of LENR/CF could mean 
for American society. Though the OTA is no longer funded and TA is no longer an integral part 
of Congress’ information gathering apparatus, TA is tool which has been used in Europe even 
after it fell out of favor in the United States. By integrating more laypeople into the actual project 
and gaining insight into underweighted or overlooked impacts, the study allows for much more 
practicality for policymakers to make informed policy choices. Since LENR/CF could upend the 
current structure of the American economy, there would need to be a study of the downstream 
effects from the introduction of a cheap and clean energy source. The web of society and its 
different factors would need a broad and deep investigation of what LENR/CF could mean. 

Correlation and causation of different impacts would need to be detailed in a formal project 
which could offer effective policy for the government, business, academia and non-profit 
organizations. Providing a proper guidebook for the potential progress of a technology this 
powerful would be valuable to show policymakers a way for plans to be formed when and if 
LENR/CF reaches commercial scale. Preparing in advance of a gathering wave could mitigate 
negative effects and enhance the positive effects.  


3 Prospective Plan for Technology Assessment of LENR/CF Case 

3.1 Form initial TA project team to bring in for the project :

3.2 Perform TA Microassessment :
Microassessment can guide the team to the best areas of research and what to make sure to 
include in the TA for the LENR/CF cased. After microassessment has been performed, the basics 
of the larger TA will be in place. The microassessment which is a “quick and dirty” can give the 
assessment team the initial context and provide a roadmap where the research should begin 
(Porter et al. p. 156) 
Formulate Plan Boundaries and Scope 
What type of TA should be undertaken? (From Coates & Porter et al.) 
For the LENR/CF case, a technology-oriented TA is best methodology to follow for this type of 
technology 

3.3 Problem/System/Technology Definition :
Decide which methodology or combination of methodologies would work the best for LENR/CF 
case. (Lee and Bereano, Coates, 1977 hearings, TA Theory, Black) 

3.4 Technology Description :
A good tool for this part of the study is a MITRE technology description checklist. Performing 
this analysis would provide most of the information for the Technology description step as well 
as the Technology forecast step 

3.5 Technology Forecast :
Though the MITRE checklist will capture most of the information for the technology forecast, 
using the techniques such as monitoring, trend extrapolation and expert opinion methods can 
help the project team with forecasting the LENR/CF field 

3.6 Social description :
Answer questions about the technology. Will it affect the society at large? Will there be impacts 
to the national conditions of the country? 

3.7 Social forecast :
Using social indicators, there are scenarios that can be used to facilitate the predicted outcome 
for the technology on society. Unlike technology forecasting, there is much more uncertainty in 
the prediction of state of society. Insight and intuition are the assessor’s best guides 
Steps 3.8-3.11 should be conducted iteratively rather than sequentially to 
determine the complete and thorough analysis for the technology  

3.8 Impact identification :
Use the EPISTLE technique to go through the impacts to the following categories: 
• Environmental 
• Psychological  
• Institutional/political 
• Social 
• Technological 
• Legal 
• Economic 
Techniques such as scanning, tracing and policy considerations are tools within the EPISTLE 
framework  

3.9 Impact analysis :
Employment of models which can simulate reality are the best tool to use to gain insight into the 
impact from the technology. A systems dynamic model which outlines feedback loops is one of 
the best models to use for LENR/CF case. 

3.10 Impact evaluation :
From the Impact identification EPISTLE tool and the models developed from Impact analysis, 
evaluating impacts allow for assigning value to the impacts. 

Three techniques could be used, but decision analysis is the best technique for LENR/CF to 
divide the decision making up.  

3.11 Policy analysis :
Policy analysis is a most important part of any assessment. It requires sufficient time and 
resources to be done well. Using the models and making explicit recommendations is option of 
the assessors and is usually desirable if the assessment team can convince its audience that is 
unbiased 

3.12 Communication of results :
The project team should be open at all times of the TA. From before the study begins to after the 
final report is released, providing open information to the public community allows for all the 
stakeholders to voice their concerns as well as advantages to the project team.

Introduction	

This

  material	
  is	
  from	
  and	
  takes	
  a	
  high-­‐level	
  view	
  of	
  Technology	
  Assessment	
  up	
  until	
  that	
point	
  in	
  time.	
  Working	
  with	
  the	
  National	
  Science	
  Foundation	
  this	
  report	
  is	
  a	
  comprehensive	
  view	
  of	
  the	
field	
  of	
  technology	
  assessment	
  and	
  how	
  it	
  has	
  been	
  deployed	
  across	
  the	
  federal	
  government.	
  The	
  report	
works	
  through	
  the	
  initial	
  phases	
  of	
  TA	
  and	
  gets	
  to	
  the	
  different	
  aspects	
  of	
  what	
  makes	
  up	
  and	
  TA	
  and	
where	
  TA	
  was	
  heading	
  to	
  at	
  this	
  point	
  in	
  time.	
  The	
  study	
  walks	
  through	
  findings	
  from	
  the	
  Congressional	
Committees	
  as	
  well	
  as	
  two	
  scientific	
  committees	
  Committee

  and	
  Public	
  Policy	
  (COSPUP)	
  and	
Committee

  (COPEP)	
  The	
  following	
  list

  outline	
  some	
  of	
  the	
  major	
findings	
  from	
  these	
  committees	
  and	
  what	
  the	
  most	
  important

  to	
  take	
  away	
  from	
  the	
  reports.	
• 
“Throughout	
  most	
  of	
  history	
  the	
  impetus	
  for	
  technological	
  innovation	
  was	
  the	
  expectation	
  of	
direct	
  benefits	
  for	
  the	
  user	
  and	
  for	
  relatively	
  small	
  segments	
  of	
  society,	
  usually	
  the	
  economic	
dominant	
  class…social	
  costs…need	
  not	
  be	
  considered	
  and	
  could	
  almost	
  said	
  to	
  have	
  been	
invisible.”	
• 
“…political	
  thinkers	
  are	
  again	
  pointing	
  to	
  the	
  seeming	
  inability	
  of	
  democratic	
  societies	
  to	
provide…	
  “stable	
  metasystems”	
  for	
  the	
  control	
  of	
  self-­‐directed,	
  change-­‐resisting	
  social	
institutions	
  which	
  are	
  powerfully	
  organized	
  to	
  maintain	
  their	
  internal	
  stability	
  and	
  survival.”	
• 
“Technology	
  Assessment	
  has	
  been	
  discussed	
  as	
  a	
  technique

Quote	
  from	
  Congressman	
  Daddario:	
  “…a	
  form	
  of	
  policy	
  research	
  which	
  provides	
  a	
  balanced	
appraisal	
  to	
  the	
  policymaker.	
  Ideally,	
  it	
  is	
  a	
  system	
  to	
  ask	
  the	
  right	
  questions	
  and	
  obtain	
  correct	
and	
  timely	
  answers.	
  It	
  identifies	
  policy	
  issues,	
  assesses	
  the	
  impacts	
  of	
  alternative	
  courses	
  of	
action,	
  and	
  presents	
  findings.	
  It	
  is	
  a	
  method	
  of	
  analysis	
  that	
  systematically	
  appraises	
  the	
  nature,	
significance,	
  status	
  and	
  merit	
  of	
  a	
  technological	
  program…	
  (and)	
  is	
  designed	
  to	
  uncover	
  three	
types	
  of	
  consequences	
  desirable,	
  undesirable	
  and	
  uncertain.”	
• 
“Perhaps	
  the	
  greatest	
  difficulty…with	
  scientific	
  information	
  was	
  that	
  ‘…members	
  of	
  Congress	
found	
  it

  P.	
  1-­‐27-­‐29:	

1. TA	

  are	
  feasible	
  and	
  useful	
  to	
  Congress	
  “when	
  prepared	
  by	
  properly	
constituted,	
  independent,	
  ad	
  hoc	
  task	
  forces	
  with	
  adequate	
  staff	
support	
  and	
  time	

2. They	

  should	
  be	
  free	
  from	
  political	
  influence	
  or	
  bias…the	
  assessment	
group	
  should	
  limit	
  itself	
  to	
  outlining	
  alternative	
  strategies	
  for	
  action	

3. Assessors	

  should	
  be	
  chosen	
  for	
  their	
  expertise	
  and	
  not	
  as	
representatives	
  of	
  affected	
  parties	
  or	
  interests	

4. Assessors	

  must	
  be	
  chosen	
  from	
  public	
  and	
  private	
  organizations	
with	
  knowledge	
  about	
  the	
  subject,	
  organizational	
  biases	
  of	
  the	
experts	
  will	
  tend	
  to	
  cancel	
  out	
  and	
  be	
  neutralized	

5. There	
  should	
  be	
  participation	
  by	
  behavioral	
  and	
  political	
  scientists;	
experience	
  shows	
  that	
  engineers,	
  economists,	
  and	
  social	
  scientists	
can	
  work	
  together	
  harmoniously	

6. To	
  be	
  of	
  most	
  use,	
  the	
  assessment	
  should	
  take	
  about	
  year	
  and	
  be	
the	
  sole	
  activity	
  of	
  the	
  research	
  group	

7. Congress	
  would	
  be	
  best	
  served	
  by	
  a	
  small	
  management	
  group	
  which	
would	
  arrange	
  for	
  the	
  TAs	
  by	
  diverse	
  organizations.	
  No	
  one	
  entity	
can	
  provide	
  adequate	
  in-­‐house	
  expertise	
  for	
  all	
  assessments	

8. Cause-­‐effect	
  analysis	
  should	
  be	
  supplemented	
  by	
  “the	
  intuitive	
judgments	
  of	
  knowledgeable	
  individuals”	

9. Assessments	
  can	
  begin	
  through	
  consideration	
  of	
  either	
  technology	
or	
  a	
  social	
  problem.	
  The	
  procedures	
  for	
  these	
  two	
  kinds	
  of	
assessments	
  will	
  differ	
  somewhat	

10. Technology-­‐initiated	
  assessment	
  requires	
  a	
  choice	
  between	
  “diffuse	
searches	
  seeking	
  some	
  early-­‐warning	
  signal”	
  and	
  “conversion	
  to	
  a	
problem-­‐oriented	
  study”	
  that	
  choses	
  the	
  most	
  significant	
(potentially	
  detrimental)	
  impacts	
  for	
  analysis.	
  The	
  latter	
  choice	
involves	
  the	
  danger	
  of	
  overlooking	
  hitherto	
  unrecognized	
  impacts	

11. Long-­‐term	
  forecasts	
  (more	
  than	
  five	
  years)	
  are	
  valuable	
  for	
  planning	
and	
  “setting	
  the	
  stage”	
  for	
  consideration	
  of	
  unforeseen	
  events,	
  but	
are	
  likely	
  to	
  be	
  unreliable	

12. Criteria	
  for	
  establishing	
  the	
  priority	
  of	
  topics	
  for	
  assessment	
  include	
the	
  breadth	
  and	
  depth	
  of	
  expected	
  social	
  impact,	
  the	
  visibility	
  of	
  the	
problems	
  to	
  legislators	
  and	
  to	
  the	
  public,	
  and	
  the	
  current	
  and	
expected	
  rates	
  of	
  development	
  of	
  the	
  technologies	

13. Appraisal	
  of	
  impacts	
  must	
  include	
  the	
  derivation	
  and	
  use	
  of	
  social	
values	
  pertinent	
  to	
  the	
  quality	
  of	
  life,	
  in	
  addition	
  to	
  conventional	
economic	
  and	
  technical	
  risk-­‐benefit	
  criteria	

14. TA	
  can	
  provide	
  the	
  public	
  support	
  necessary	
  for	
  national	
  programs	
designed	
  to	
  secure	
  the	
  benefits	
  and	
  avoid	
  the	
  problem	
  of	
technological	
  advances.

1. Systems	
  analysis	
  is	
  a	
  technique	
  for	
  analyzing	
  the	
  performance

  of	
  quantified	
relationships

  performance,

1. Wide-­‐scope	
  TAs	
  
Studies	
  which	
  represented	
  a	
  relatively	
  high	
  level	
  of	
  effort	
  
Analyzed	
  the	
  potential	
  impacts	
  of	
  a	
  technology	
  over	
  a	
  wide	
range	
  of	
  possibilities	
  (social,	
  institutional	
  or	
  political,	
economic,	
  environmental,	
  and	
  ethical	
  impacts	
  or	
  some	
combination)	
  
Also	
  to	
  be	
  considered	
  wide-­‐scope,	
  they	
  had	
  to	
  meet	
  two	
additional	
  criteria:	
• 
Must	
  have	
  been	
  addressed	
  to	
  a	
  public	
  policy	
  issue	
or	
  potential	
  decision	
• 
Must	
  have	
  utilized	
  a	
  multi-­‐disciplinary	
  team	

2. Narrow	
  or	
  partial	
  assessments	
  
In	
  generally,	
  these	
  studies	
  considered	
  some	
  pre-­‐selected	
kinds	
  of	
  impacts,	
  most	
  often	
  economic	
  or	
  environmental,	
which	
  did	
  however	
  go	
  beyond	
  the	
  primary,	
  planned	
consequences	
  of	
  the	
  technology	
  or	
  project	
  
The	
  studies	
  were	
  not	
  concerned	
  solely	
  with	
  performance	
characteristics	
  or	
  technical	
  feasibility	
  
The	
  distinction	
  between	
  wide-­‐scope	
  assessments	
  and	
narrow	
  or	
  partial	
  assessments	
  was	
  admittedly	
  arbitrary	
  
For	
  the	
  most	
  part	
  they	
  did	
  not	
  address	
  a	
  specific	
  policy	
decision	
  or	
  action,	
  were	
  not	
  funded	
  to	
  the	
  same	
  level	
  as	
  the	
wide-­‐scope	
  and	
  they	
  utilized	
  only	
  few	
  disciplines	
  on	
  their	
research	
  teams	

3. Problem-­‐Oriented	
  Assessments	
  
Focus	
  on	
  a	
  problem	
  such	
  as	
  environmental	
  pollution	
  and	
identify	
  the	
  technologies	
  which	
  contribute	
  to	
  the	
  problem	
or	
  may	
  be	
  used	
  to	
  alleviate

Methodological	
  Framework	
There	
  are	
  several	
  lists	
  contained	
  in	
  this	
  paper	
  which	
  provide	
  a	
  good	
  summary	
  of	
  the	
  way	
  that

be	
  structured	
  to	
  include	
  the	
  most	
  critical	
  elements	
  of	
  the	
  subject	
  to	
  be	
  studied.	

A	
  set	
  of	
  prescriptions	
  should	
  be	
  followed	
  by	
  assessors	
  for	
  a	
  TA	
  methodology:	

1. Statement	
  of	
  problem	
  to	
  be	
  considered	

2. Definition	
  of	
  system	

3. Identification	
  of	
  potential	
  impacts	

4. Evaluation	
  of	
  impacts	

5. Definition	
  of	
  the	
  relevant	
  decision-­‐making	
  apparatus	

6. Laying	
  out	
  options	
  for	
  the	
  decision	
  maker	

7. Identification	
  of	
  parties	
  of	
  interest;	
  potential	
  “winners”	
  and	
  “losers”	

8. Definition	
  of	
  macroalternatives	

9. Identification	
  of	
  exogenous	
  variables	

10. Conclusion	
  and	
  possibly	
  recommendations	
This	
  is	
  just	
  one	
  way	
  of	
  following	
  a	
  methodology	
  for	
  a	
  TA.	
  The	
  authors	
  of	
  this	
  paper	
  make	
  very	
  clear	
  that	
there	
  is	
  “no	
  validated,	
  universally	
  accepted	
  methodology	
  for	
  TA.”	
One	
  rule	
  of	
  thumb	
  for	
  a	
  TA	
  would	
  be	
  focusing	
  the	
  project	
  in	
  the	
  following	
  ways.	
  on	
  defining	
  and	
exploring	
  the	
  technologies	
  being	
  assessed,	
  on	
  establishing	
  the	
  non-­‐technological	
  setting	
  in	
  which	
the	
  technology	
  would	
  be	
  imbedded	
  and	
  almost	
  on	
  identifying	
  and	
  analyzing	
  the	
  societal	
  impacts	
generated	
  by	
  the	
  technology.	

Another	
  section	
  of	
  the	
  paper	
  gives	
  a	
  more	
  general	
  summary	
  of	
  what	
  TAs	
  will	
  contain	
  in	
  the	
  report:	

1. An	
  overall	
  framework	

2. A	
  management	
  plan	
  for	
  allocation	
  of	
  time	
  or	
  effort	
  to	
  different	
  project	
  tasks	

3. Carefully	
  considered	
  use	
  of	
  specialized	
  techniques	
  for	
  portions	
  of	
  the	
  overall	
  analysis	

4. Methods	
  for	
  structuring	
  the	
  interaction	
  among	
  assessment	
  participants	

5. Attention	
  to	
  considerations	
  for	
  “knowledge”	
  to	
  foster	
  new	
  insights	
This	
  provides	
  a	
  good	
  framework	
  to	
  designing	
  the	
  TA	
  for	
  LENR/CF.	
  It	
  gets	
  to	
  the	
  crux	
  of	
  what	
  exactly	
  a	
  TA	
needs	
  to	
  include	
  and	
  how	
  to	
  start	
  a	
  TA	
  from	
  scratch.	

The	
  L&B	
  paper	
  makes	
  a	
  number	
  of	
  observations	
  which	
  should	
  be	
  key	
  to	
  any	
  scientific	
  research,	
  but	
  will	
be	
  very	
  important	
  for	
  a	
  TA	
  on	
  LENR/CF:	
“…bias	
  should	
  be	
  suppressed,	
  the	
  overall	
  technology	
  assessment	
  process	
  contains	
  elements	
  that	
  are	
normative,	
  judgmental,	
  creative,	
  and	
  subjective.”	
“…the	
  quantification	
  of	
  social	
  benefits	
  and	
  disbenefits	
  often	
  obscures	
  the	
  difficult	
  task	
  of	
  separating	
  fact	
from	
  opinion.”	
“…assessors	
  cannot	
  make	
  a	
  neutral,	
  objective	
  and	
  value-­‐free	
  analysis	
  of	
  all	
  topics	
  of	
  concern,	
  the	
  need	
for	
  representation	
  of	
  all	
  viewpoints	
  must	
  be	
  satisfied.”	
Another	
  key	
  insight	
  that	
  is	
  critical	
  for	
  any	
  TA	
  is	
  the	
  practice	
  of	
  bounding.	
  In	
  theory,	
  a	
  problem	
  can	
  be	
extended	
  infinitely	
  without	
  method	
  to	
  limit	
  the	
  scope	
  of	
  the	
  study	
  in	
  order	
  to	
  keep	
  primary	
  focus	
  on	
what	
  the	
  TA	
  seeks	
  to	
  explore.	
  The	
  L&B

  nine	
  factors	
  to	
  bound	
  the	
  TA.

Chapter 1 -p.4 
TA usually deals with a technology that could be geographically situated almost anywhere 
In terms of policy, TA is likely to explore a wide range of possible subsidies, incentives, 
regulations, and so forth 
Chapter 2  
The technological component and its ties to human society [are] intensifying with the passage of 
time 
The technological society is not without its problems. In many cases technological developments 
have been seen as causing social problems. Cases of “social shock” are caused by technological 
developments that went wrong 
The notion of assessing technology has originated from the convergence of two observations: 
p.11 
(1) that technology is a crucial force in modern society 
(2) and that technological developments can go awry 
Technology Causes Social Change – p.16 
1. Technological advance creates a new opportunity to achieve some desired goal  
2. This requires (except in trivial cases) alterations in social organization if advantages is to 
be taken of this new opportunity 
3. Which means that the functions of existing social structures will be altered  
4. With the result that other goals that were served by the older structures are now 
inadequately achieved 
Mesthene sees society as basically reacting to technology rather than leading it. New 
technology alters the range of available choice   
Chapter 4 – Basic Features of an Assessment 
Assessment Objectives:  
The Large Picture 
Assessments:  
(1) provide pertinent information to policy makers 
(2) alert concerned people who, in turn, influence the policy making process  
(3) may even contribute to serious thought about societal values 
Each assessment has its own context, sponsor, particular interests, and unique problem 
definition. There are main general objectives that apply across all assessments: p.44 
(1) Validity 
a. Validity carries a host of precise connotations  
b. Generally refers to being well-grounded in fact and verifiable 
c. In the case of research dealing with the future, we take validity to refer to the 
congruence between predicted and actual results 
d. Since the results of an assessment apply to the future, and since their 
correspondence with actual happenings may vary as a function of time, the 
validity of an assessment will remain uncertain 

i. Cause and Effect Understanding 
1. A technological intervention as a cause produces impacts as it 
effects. These impacts, in turn acting as causes, may produce other 
impacts as (higher-order) effects. The central task of an assessment 
is to understand the full set of interactions involved in the coupling 
between technology and society. 

ii. Balance 
1. An assessment should provide a balanced appraisal to the policy 
maker. “Balance” refers to an even-handed treatment of the major 
assessment issues, both in terms of coverage all important aspects 
and in relation of salient points of view  
a. A value-explicit approach in which the assessors attempt to 
lay out as clearly as possible the divergent value 
perspectives involved in the issue 
b. More importantly, the assessors should try to spell out their 
assumptions and make clear their personal allegiances, so 
that the users of their study can judge the positions taken.  
iii. Methodological Soundness  


1. TAs should use the available, relevant data and follow established 
scientific principles and procedures 
2. When reasonable, the reproducibility of results should be 
ascertained  
(2) Utility –p.46 
a. The utility of a TA is determined by how much useful information the study 
provides to its sponsor, to parties impacted by its subject, and to makers of 
decisions involving the assessment subject 
b. Utility depends on such factors as the time a study becomes available relative to 
when a decision must be made, the study content, and the presentation 
c. Utility can be gauged as the difference, in terms of information gained, the study 
makes to its potential users
 
i. Relevance 
1. An assessment is irrelevant and hence useless if it does not ask the 
questions that the sponsors and parties at interest need answered 

ii. Timeliness 
1. In a policy context, it is imperative that an assessment be available 
when the time is ripe. Time pressure can also be a major constraint 
on the depth of analysis possible 
iii. Credibility  
1. Whatever the validity of a report, it is valueless unless the audience 
believes the report to be worthy of consideration 
iv. Communicability 
1. Unless the findings are presented in a usable format, the study may 
receive scant attention 
2. This threat is particularly acute in the case of more quantitative 
approaches that use elaborate techniques. 
(3) Improving assessment methodology 
a. Given the social importance of TA, continued methodological advance through 
development and refinement of study strategies and techniques that lead to valid 
and useful results should be carefully considered in every significant study  
Types of Assessment – p.47  
TA is differentiated in terms of its  
(1) Comprehensive view of complex issues 
(2) Requirement of many disciplines, working in an interdisciplinary mode 
(3) Component tasks (beginning with a need to structure the problem and continuing through 
analysis of policy options) 
TA stands apart for its breadth, interest in higher order effects, and concern for all parties at 
interest 
Three Types of TA – p.51 
(1) Project Assessment – a focus on a particular, localized project such as a nuclear power 
plant 
(2) Problem Oriented Assessment – a focus on solutions of a specific problem, such as an 
energy shortage 
(3) Technology Oriented Assessment – a focus on examining a new technology and trace its 
impacts on the society – most likely outcome for the LENR/CF case 
a. Technology oriented assessment often deal with innovative technologies. 
Important considerations in a technology-oriented assessment are the forms of 
technology, the time frame of the innovation process and the ways in which the 
implementation of the technology are likely to occur 
b. The time frame covered by such an assessment is typically more open than other 
assessment types 
c. As a result, the range of societal outcomes is generally wider 
d. The policy content is more diffuse since the options are great and the uncertainties 
large 
A Family of Assessment Studies – p.53 
Macroassessment (comprehensive, full-scale): 
Full range if implications and policies considered in depth (on the order of magnitude of 5 
person-years work for technology-oriented assessment) 
Miniassessment: 
Narrow in-depth, or broad but shallow focus (about an order of magnitude smaller than the 
macroassessment in work effort) 
Microassessment: 
A though experiment, or brainstorming assessment exercise to identify the key issues or establish 
the broad dimensions of a problem (about an order of magnitude smaller than the 
miniassessment, say 1-person-month of effort) 
Monitoring:  
Ongoing gathering of selected information on a topic. May be done formally or informally; as a 
result of a prior assessment identifying critical uncertainties; and/or as a way to identify critical 
changes that warrant a new assessment 
Evaluation: 
 Evaluation of ongoing projects and programs can determine whether alterations or new 
programs are needed. In addition these can provide feedback as to the validity of previous TA 
predictions 
Components of a TA – p.54 
(1) Problem definition 
(2) Technology description 
(3) Technology forecast 
(4) Social description 
(5) Social forecast 
(6) Impact identification 
(7) Impact analysis 
(8) Impact evaluation 
(9) Policy analysis 
Communication of results 
The effects of Technology – p.59 – a breakdown of the orders of effects from the introduction of 
television 
Problem definition – p. 65 
The first step in comtemplating an assessment – whether as sponsor or assessor- is to challenge 
its existence. Taking as broad and open a perspective as possible, one should pose questions such 
as: 
(1) Why study this technology or project? What can be gained from this assessment 
(2) IS there are core problem reflected in the assessment assignment? 
(3) What conditions cause the problem or pose essential opportunities? 
(4) What assumptions are being accepted in the TA formulation? 
(5) Would reasonable changes in assumptions make a core problem disappear? 
(6) Who are the parties at interest to the technology or project? How do their values differ? 
(7) Are there other social values meriting consideration? 

Bounding an Assessment – p.66  
Bounding a TA – that is – setting limits is difficult to accomplish, deeply intertwined with the 
other assessment tasks, and crucial to the effective conduct and completion of the assessment. 

Bounding an assessment should be an ongoing activity. It depends on constraints set by the study 
sponsor, and also on characteristics of the development under assessment, the critical impact 
areas and selection of policy option 
Areas for Bounding – p.67 
Time horizons – extent of future projecting and the intermediate “viewing times” are central to 
problem bounding. Could chose a 10 to 25 years or more for the scope of the study 
Spatial extent – is the primary emphasis of the study local, regional, state or national concern. 

Defining the spatial boundaries is important for which policy makers and which policy 
jurisdictions will be included 
Institutional Involvements – Institutions considered should those affecting policy, those likely to 
use the study and those impacted by the technology in question 
Technology and Range of Application – Limiting technological options to a feasible range may 
be important for emerging technologies and for technological solutions to social problems. 

Innovative and unconventional alternatives should be included whenever time, funds, and 
sponsors permit  
Impact Sectors- criteria for the selection of impact sectors for in-depth treatment should be 
established to ensure coverage of all areas critical to policy considerations. An initial 
microassessment is the best means of determining which impact areas to assign highest priority 
Policy Options- a wide latitude of policy possibilities exists, especially in emerging and social 
technologies. Limiting the range must be consistent with the thrust of the assessment. In 
particular, the sponsor and assessment team must agree upon the range and limits of radical or 
utopian policy options to be considered 
 Technology Description and Forecasting – p.98 
Comprehensive description of the state of the art of a technology is necessary but not sufficient 
for accurate prediction of its future impact. The technology must also be projected along feasible 
paths into the future. 

What is the emergence of the technology  and what is it impact?

Technology forecasting- p .113 
Monitoring – assumption that technological change is foreshadowed by changes in the political, 
technical, economic, ecological, and/or social environments. Therefore it should be possible to 
monitor signals in these environments, analyze them and forecast the emergence of new 
technologies. 

Trend extrapolation – p.115 
A technique which attempts to capture the historical progress of a technology in a mathematical 
expression or graphical display. Once determined this information can be used to project or 
extrapolate performance at a future time, provided that no discontinuities occur. 

Expert Opinion Methods – p. 122 
“Asking a person who knows” – surveys and soliciting predictions from people in the field 
Social Description and Forecasting – p.135 
Social Description – will this technology affect society at large? P.138 
(1) No war will result from this technology 
(2) No internal conflict will undermine or overthrow the present democratic system 
(3) No major shifts in the balance of power between government and private decision 
making or between federal, state and local governments 
(4) Value system may change, the so-called Puritan ethic which prizes work and personal 
achievement will not change 
Will there be changes to the national conditions? 
(1) Population size 
(2) Adjusted GDP growth rate 
(3) Proportion of federal spending in defense and civilian programs 
(4) Shift in industrial structure from manufacturing to services 
Six major categories for the state of society: 
(1) Values and goals 
(2) Demography 
(3) Environment 
(4) Economics 
(5) Social factors 
(6) Institutions 
Will the technology change social indicators? See page 141 
Social forecasting – p.148 
Using social indicators, there are scenarios that can be used to facilitate the predicted outcome 
for the technology on society. Unlike technology forecasting, there is much more uncertainty in 
the prediction of state of society. Insight and intuition are the assessor’s best guides 
Impact Assessment – p.156 
Impact identification, impact analysis, impact evaluation and policy impact analysis must be 
executed iteratively to allow for the process to produce the most effective results. 

The assessment team must select the “important” impacts to be analyzed. The determination of 
which impacts are most important is of course “a judgment call”. That judgment call must be 
based on sound understanding of the sponsor, the interests of potential users of the TA, as well as 
the probability, timing, and extent of the impacts themselves. 

Impact Identification Strategies 
By using a technique which can divide the complex field into smaller, more easily examined 
sectors. One way to divide the complex field is to use a technique known as EPISTLE: 
• Environmental 
• Psychological  
• Institutional/political 
• Social 
• Technological 
• Legal 
• Economic 
Impact identification techniques – p.162 
Scanning – assembling a checklist 
Tracing p.168  – relevance tree which can branch out based on the impact from the introduction 
of the technology 
Policy considerations –p .176 
The focus of assessments should be policy. Assessment results will generally be useful to 
sponsors only insofar as they delineate effective policy alternatives.  

There are no set criteria for impact identification, but there are many considerations to include: 
Type of perspective – reductionist or holistic 
Selection of identification techniques for scanning or tracing the impact field 
Choice of resource people to employ in impact identification – only those on the project team, or 
persons external to the team as well 
Successful strategy must blend these decisions with the following study characteristics and 
constraints: 
• Characteristics of technology 
• Characteristics of the impacts 
• Characteristics of the team members 
• Sponsor and potential study user requirements 
• Resource constraints 
• Study time constraints  
Impact Analysis 
Impact analysis links the identification of significant impact to their evaluation and formulation 
of effective policy to deal with them 
Models are the best way to determine impacts from the technology 
Models are systematic arrangements of elements that are intended to represent real-world 
systems in structure and/or behavior 
Any model is a representation of a simplification of reality, but must consider the following 
dimensions: 
• Complexity (few to many variables) 
• Time (static to dynamic) 
• Uncertainty (deterministic to probabilistic 
Models include p.210: 
• Physical models 
• Planning models 
• Gaming models that allow stakeholders to act out their inclinations and see the 
implications 
• System dynamic models which show counter-intuitive workings of feedback 
relationships 
• Probabilistic systems dynamics models that incorporate influences of uncertain future 
events 
• Monte Carlo methods to sample probability distributions 
• Queuing and Markov approaches to stochastic situations 
• Bayesian statistics to combine prior knowledge with new information   
Impact Evaluation – p.351 
Evaluation is the process of assigning value. The value of something is assigned relative to that 
of something comparable with which evaluator is familiar.   

There are several techniques to evaluate the impacts 
Dimensionless Scaling – p.362  
In this simple approach, impacts are rated on a common “dimensionless” scale and displayed in a 
matrix format. This technique is simple, takes relatively little time to perform, and produces an 
output that is clear and easy for users to comprehend. Its disadvantages are that is generally 
subjective and any quantification is open to criticism.   

Decision Analysis – p. 363  
This technique is a term for a number of techniques intended to quantify and systematize 
decision making, particularly under conditions of uncertainty or risk. Decision analysis can be 
subdivided into four basic categories: 
(1) Certainty – an action results in one and only one outcome 
(2) Risk – an action can result in more than one outcome depending on external conditions 
that have known probabilities of occurrence 
(3) Uncertainty – an action can result in more than one outcome depending on external 
conditions of unknown probability  
(4) Conflict – external conditions are replaced by a competitor  
Major advantages of decision analysis in the evaluation of complex problems is that it provides 
an ordered, systematic, and quantified framework that yields reproducible results. One of its 
disadvantages is that is requires considerable time, effort, and planning. It is also highly specific 
to the value set of the decision maker for whom it is developed.   

Policy capture - p. 367  
Alternative values allow for the evaluation to incorporate stakeholders into the process. Policy 
capture attempts to weigh the factors considered in reaching a decision. Simply put, policy 
capture constructs a mathematical model to parallel the actual decision process. One or more 
representatives of each stakeholder group judge the relative acceptability of each scenario. 

Multiple regression analysis is then used to determine weights implicitly placed by the 
stakeholder on each factor in reaching a judgment of acceptability. It has two main disadvantages 
(1) it is difficult to be sure that all factors pertinent to the decision process have been included. 
(2) a good deal of time is required to the participants in the study 
Impact evaluation – p. 371  
Impacts, once identified and analyzed must be evaluated in the light of societal values. 

Evaluation is intended to assess the costs and benefits proceeding from a technology or its 
alternatives and provide a foundation for policy formulation.  

Policy Analysis – p. 397  
Policies are guiding principles in both the public and private sectors 
Policy studies address policy formulation, implementation, effects, and methodology 
Models of the policy process include:  
• Rational model 
• Institutional model 
• Group equilibrium model 
• Elite model 
• Incremental model 
• Systems model 
Policy analysis consists of a thoughtful consideration of what is likely to happen under 
alternatives courses of action 
Policy analysis should usually include participation by policy makers and impacted publics – the 
policy community 
Making explicit recommendations is option of the assessors and should depend on study context. 

Explicit recommendations are usually desirable if the assessment team can convince its audience 
that is unbiased 
Policy analysis is a most important part of any assessment. It requires sufficient time and 
resources to be done well.  

Communication of Results – p. 417 
Effective communication of TA findings requires considerations of assessors and study users and 
ways to facilitate information exchange in both directions between the two communities. Three 
factors that greatly affect the communication to the prospective users: 
(1) The level of knowledge about the assessment held by the potential user beforehand 
(2) The amount of new knowledge the assessment provided 
(3) Whether the assessment was compatible with the interests if the user’s organizations 
The TA result should be presented with four characteristics to make policy: 
(1) Regard the TA subject matter as important 
(2) Do long-range planning 
(3) Have made or plan to make decisions relevant to the issues addressed  
(4) Are receptive to externally produced information  
Life-cycle for TA results: 
Before the study: intended study should be identified and its information needs understood 
During the study: Carefully considered interactions between potential users and study producers 
can take several forms with different purposes. Study methods, completeness and assumptions 
should be weighed against user perceptions of what makes for a credible assessment  
The report itself: This should match user needs, with attention to length, summary preparation, 
integration, writing style, and graphics. 

After the study: A variety of written, oral and “nontraditional” dissemination means should be 
selected to best match the users intended users’ interests

Energy From the West 
Description  
For this appendix, the analysis will focus on the First Year Work Plan of the Western Energy 
Resources TA and the Work plan for Completing the TA of Western Energy Resources and the 
Final Report because since this TA was a very large undertaking. Viewing the entire scope of the 
project makes it more interesting and the way it was completed is more important for the 
LENR/CF case.  

Conceptual Approach & Issues Addressed  
The Energy from the West TA was a very large project and viewed the “West” holistically when 
it came to examining the different energy technologies that were at hand. The following quote is 
a way to view the TA process from a high level of detail: 
“Although the scope of the assessment is limited as described above, its overall purpose will not 
be achieved if the concerns of the local, state and federal governments, interstate and regional 
governmental organizations, industry, labor, Indians and other ethnic and minority groups, and 
other interested groups and individuals are not taken into account. Consequently, the assessment 
described in this work plan is designed to produce policy-informing results useful to those who 
have responsibilities for or an interest in the development of western energy resources.”  
This is the way that the LENR/CF TA should be conducted. Without a concrete policy in mind, 
the plans and views contained are not all that practical.  

Whom was the TA Performed for? /Who Performed the TA? 

The TA was performed for the US Environmental Protection Agency Office of Research and 
Development. 

The TA work was performed by the Science and Public Policy Program at the University of 
Oklahoma and Radian Corporation.  

Outcome & Recommendations 
The process took three years to complete and examined six energy resources in eight Western 
states. There is no direct takeaway because the general answer is yes, the west has energy and it 
should be produced. Here are the items that need to be taken into account from a policy 
perspective to protect the social, environmental effects for the people in the Western area.  

Applicability to LENR/CF Case 
The first year work plan has three phases for its analysis: descriptive, interactive, and integrative. 

The three phases are an interesting way to view the technology. The descriptive phase, 
interactive phase and integrative phase are a collection of comprehensive analysis to view a 
problem. For a LENR/CF TA attempt, this table of contents could provide a good template to 
design a system of analysis for the projects outcome. LENR/CF will need to be explained in a 
similar sort of way. An outline of the first year of work would contribute toward a successful 
project in that discovering the full range of costs and benefits can give decision makers the 
information that they need to determine the outcome of the funding of LENR/CF research.   

One paragraph from the First Year work plan illustrates the need for multidiscipline input into 
the iterative process of TA. The LENR/ CF case must be viewed through a multi-disciplinary 
lens for it to have the most comprehensive view. 

The work plan to complete the TA is important because it takes all the information that had been 
gathered up to that point and made decisions on how to complete the study 
The final report for the Energy from the West TA is very interesting in the way it is organized 
and the critical areas that this report chose to focus on. The report limited the scope of the states 
to Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New 
Mexico. So the study limited the geographic area. Also, within that eight state area, the study 
focused on six sites within that geography. The LENR/CF case may not focus on specific states, 
but it may be useful to focus on particular areas where the technology may be more beneficial 
based on the economic makeup of that area. For instance, if the LENR/CF device can produce 
enough steam for electricity it may make sense to look for areas which have coal plants that are 
being retire so these boilers can be placed into existing infrastructure rather than building 
something from scratch 
The study also limited the technologies that it would focus on: crude oil, natural gas, coal, 
uranium, oil shale and geothermal. This helped to limit the effects from technology development. 

By limiting the types of technologies the impacts of the technologies were limited as well. 

LENR/CF TA should be limited as well. From the literature, there is a lot of products and plans 
that are called LENR/CF. Finding to the most promising technologies and evaluating those is a 
good way to structure the TA/ .  

This holds promise for the final report for the LENR/CF TA there is a template to limit the scope 
and the impacts of the study to prevent the project from spilling out into too many directions.   

The format that the Final Report takes could be a nearly direct template for which the LENR/CF 
case could follow. It mirrors most of the information that would be needed to make a LENR/CF 
Ta fully complete.

A Technology Assessment of Coal Slurry Pipelines 
Description  
This TA was designed to study the effect of using coal slurry pipelines as a means to move coal 
from place to place in the United States. This TA is investigating the future and prospects for 
building coal slurry pipelines within the United States. The study investigates the costs as well as 
the impacts from deployment of this type of technology. Not just focusing on economic impacts, 
the study also touches on social and environmental impacts as well.   

Conceptual Approach & Issues Addressed 
One of the key statements from this TA is that the information contained within it is “based on 
simplifying assumption and considerable speculation about the future.” 
Within the study, there are four studies which make up a subset of the TA. The first sub-study 
focuses on the volumes of coal which may form the baseline for coal shipped until the year 2000 
for different regions of the country.  

The second sub-study focuses on estimates of cost and market scenarios which would drive the 
project economics. It also attempts to add up the total social costs of electric power generation, 
which includes service quality and cost, employment and other economic measures.  

The third sub-study covers the social and environmental impacts of the use of water to ship the 
coal through a slurry pipeline. There is a contrast and comparison between the movement of coal 
by pipeline and rail and offers the comprehensive view of the alternatives and the plans which 
the study had in mind.  

The fourth study was subjecting the rest of the analysis to a sensitivity analysis which gives the 
effects of changes in the variables to the rest of the study.  

Whom was the TA Performed for? /Who Performed the TA? 

This TA was performed for the US Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, US 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and US House of Representatives 
Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce 
The TA was performed by the OTA Coal Slurry Pipeline Project Staff as well as a group of 
consultants. The study was overseen by the Coal Slurry Pipeline Advisory Panel (which was 
made up of those in government, private industry and academia) and the OTA Energy Advisory 
Committee (which was made of people industry and academia)  
Outcome & Recommendations 
In certain cases, the study recommends the use of coal slurry pipelines and offers the 
circumstances for which they would make sense.  

The study makes a point of arguing the alternatives for transporting coal. The two main 
alternatives are rail and pipeline. The study concludes that if the regulatory framework was 
modified with respect to the power of eminent domain, the pipelines would enjoy a considerable 
advantage over the  
Applicability to LENR/CF Case 
Both the coal slurry pipeline and the costal energy TAs are mainly focused on evaluating 
alternatives. For a TA on LENR/CF, the alternatives would probably be less economic and more 
social because if the promises of LENR/CF became true, the costs would cancel out most of the 
other forms of energy generation. The economic evaluations would be better suited to measuring 
what displacement effects would create opportunities for the government to help manage the 
transition to LENR/CF. 

The way in which the sub-studies make up a larger TA makes sense for the LENR/CF case as 
different studies could view different parts of the whole if this technology were to take hold. One 
study could focus on the electric generation parts of LENR/CF and another could focus on the 
economic issues with the introduction of this technology. The sensitivity analysis could change 
assumptions and affect the way in which different parts of the field take shape. If the costs are 
higher for one technology or another, then energy may have to come from other sources. The 
study must make it clear of the assumptions which are being taken into account, whether it is just 
a source of excess heat and has limited other benefits or of the LENR/CF technology can be 
ramped up and applied in creating more meaningful energy such as steam for electricity 
production or for transportation.

Coastal Effects of Offshore Energy Systems 
Description  
This TA is concentrated solely on several sources of energy generation in a specific area of the 
United States, New Jersey and Delaware. The three energy systems that this TA is focusing on 
are oil and natural gas development, installation of deepwater port to accommodate 
Supertankers, and construction of at least two floating nuclear powerplants. 

Conceptual Approach & Issues Addressed  
The TA went about assessing the impacts for three types of energy systems if they were 
deployed in New Jersey and Delaware.  
• Offshore Oil and Gas Development 
• Floating Nuclear Plant 
• Deepwater Ports which could accept new supertankers 
The study analyzed the federal regulations, environmental role, technical designs, risks from 
accidents, economic impacts as well as many other impacts that could happen depending on the 
decision that policymakers make on these technologies. The study also outlines several 
alternatives to the three technologies that are proposed in the study. Most of the alternatives are 
conventional and this comparison of the alternatives lays out the evidence all at once to help 
normalize the technologies and make for more informed decision-making between alternatives.  

The study looked at the background of each technology, what would be necessary for 
deployment, what effects would take place on the coast, and what the risks and safety issues are. 

There is also an entire section dedicated to the public participation which informed the 
decisionmakers and led to the important input from those people who could be affected by 
decisions.

This TA was performed for the US Senate National Ocean Policy Study group 
The TA was performed by OTA Oceans Program Staff and was overseen by the Oceans 
Assessment Advisory Panel 
Outcome & Recommendations 
The study found that there was not likely to be significant damage to the environment or changes 
in the patterns of life in either New Jersey or Delaware. The study makes it clear that these 
operations are very complex and require a lot of oversight and strict operational monitoring.  

The study makes it clear that the idea of a floating nuclear plant involves unique risks, all of 
which have not yet been studied in great detail. The study calls for changes within the federal 
government which would allow for more exploration of the offshore oil and gas resources. 

The last point that the study makes is that there is are no alternatives within the group studied 
which offer a clear social, environmental, or economic advantage over the others.  

Applicability to LENR/CF Case 
The use of public input to the TA would be important. It would help outline the biggest concerns 
over the introduction to the technology. Though experts would be necessary for most of the 
analysis, the use of a public forum would allow the policy to take into account all of the possible 
outcomes which could take place.  

Viewing the LENR/CF case through its anticipated effect, the process of implementing the 
technology, and the preferences and alternatives to LENR/CF would be a beneficial way to 
conduct the TA.

Renewing Our Energy Future 
Description  
This TA analyzes the development of Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs) in the United 
States from the mid-1970’s to 1995.  

Conceptual Approach & Issues Addressed  
Viewed the technologies from where they would be deployed. Agricultural crops is not really a 
“space” where the other chapters have space as an attribute. The TA moves from Buildings, to 
Transport, to Electricity and then to foreign countries which has a way of organizing itself in a 
way to frame the different energy technologies for the country.  

Whom was the TA Performed for? /Who Performed the TA? 

This TA was completed for US Senator Charles Grassley, the US House of Representatives 
Committee on Science and its Subcommitee on Energy and Environment, two Subcommittees of 
the US House of Representatives Committee on Agriculture – Department Operations, Nutrition 
and Foreign Agriculture and Resource Conservation, Research and Forestry; the House 
Subcommittee on Energy and Environment of the Committee on Appropriations. 

The TA work was completed by the OTA project staff and was overseen by an Advisory Panel 
which was made up of people from academia, private industry, non-profits and industry interest 
groups. There were also third-party contributors and reviewers which added to the multi-
disciplinary aspect of the project.  

Outcome & Recommendations 
The TA outlines different policy options which could be used to make the technologies more 
cost effective and lead to outcomes which could strengthen the renewable energy market.   

Applicability to LENR/CF Case 
The LENR/CF case could be argued to be a renewable energy technology so the way that the TA 
goes through the different areas where RETs are deployed makes perfect sense for LENR/TA. 

The way that LENR/CF could change the electricity market, residential and commercial 
buildings as well as transport and agriculture would all be important areas which the LENR/CF 
TA could touch on. Going through each area of society in a clear and organized way would be 
useful for the LENR/CF TA.

Energy Technology Choices: Shaping Our Future 
Description 	
This TA covers the various energy technologies that existed in 1991 that could provide energy 
sources for the United States.  

Conceptual Approach & Issues Addressed  
The three uncertainties that the TA addressed were:  


1. How	
  to	
  assure	
  a	
  long-­‐term	
  supply	
  of	
  reasonably	
  priced,	
  convenient	
  fuels,	
  especially	
  for	
transportation	
2. How	
  to	
  protect	
  the	
  country	
  against	
  disruptions	
  of	
  petroleum	
  imports	
3. How	
  to	
  mitigate	
  emissions	
  of	
  carbon	
  dioxide	
Whom was the TA Performed for? /Who Performed the TA? 

US Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resource, US House of Representatives 
Committee on Government Operations, and US House of Representatives Committee on Energy 
and Commerce 
The TA work was completed by the OTA Project Staff and was overseen by an Advisory Panel 
which included people from government, academia, private industry and non-profit organizations 
Outcome & Recommendations 
All options entail some compromises as the study has claimed there is no single energy panacea 
that can solve all the long-term requirements for the United States.  

The TA lays out several scenarios that the nation could follow: 
• 
Emphasizing	
  production	
  of	
  conventional	
  fuels	
• 
Improving	
  efficiency	
  of	
  use	
  to	
  the	
  economic	
  optimum	
• 
Minimizing	
  the	
  use	
  of	
  energy	
  as	
  far	
  as	
  is	
  technologically	
  possible	
• 
Emphasizing	
  renewable	
  energy	
  sources	
• 
Emphasizing	
  nuclear	
  energy	
The last two chapter which compares all the scenarios offers a picture for what will happen in 
different cases both in the economic outcomes and policy outcomes.  

Applicability to LENR/CF Case 
The scenario analysis is a very powerful tool that could be applied to the LENR/CF TA as the 
different outcomes for the research in the field could guide policymakers to make the correct 
decisions. Evaluating the different ways which the changes could occur could be paired with the 
evidence based judgments which can be a signal from the field as to what the results from the 
experiments are.  

The way in which scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis could be combined to make the 
what-if situations more real and give a lot of help in guiding policymakers to possible outcomes 
from pursuing the LENR/CF technologies as an energy source.

Appendix C: Participatory Technology Assessment 
Participatory Technology Assessment  
Community-Based Research and Technoscience Activism 
• “…science shops provide knowledge and skills to civil society members as well as 
students and university researchers; they build equitable partnerships between researchers 
and civil society organizations; and they inform university leaders and policy-makers of 
the research and education needs of civil society.” 
• Likewise, HIV/AIDS activists, opponents of digital surveillance, seed savers, and 
movements against advanced weapons systems represent but a few of the many 
grassroots engagements with specific arenas of science and technology that seek 
democratization and accountability.  
• Community-based research has a wellspring of energy and authenticity which is 
grounded in local issues 
• Movements focused on specific technologies are constrained by a different concreteness 
that requires sustained focus on the industries that deploy these technologies and the 
policy venues that promote and regulate them.  

Reinventing Technology Assessment   
• Over time, taking the public’s pulse became integrated into our work on understanding 
the risks and benefits of new technologies and convinced us that public policy can be 
improved through sustained and carefully crafted dialogue with laypeople. But it also 
became obvious that interaction with the public was neither an accepted practice nor a 
desired outcome in most areas of science and technology (S&T) policy. The idea of 
“engaging the public” has had high rhetorical value in the S&T community, but little 
practical impact on decision-making. 
• Technology assessment (TA) is a practice intended to enhance societal understanding of 
the broad implications of science and technology. This creates the possibility of preparing 
for – or constructively influencing – developments to ensure better outcomes.  
• Meanwhile, there are now a dozen parliamentary TA agencies in Europe. They have 
developed many promising TA practices, including highly effective methods involving 
participation by everyday citizens.* 
• Participatory technology assessment (pTA) enables laypeople, who are otherwise 
minimally represented in the politics of science and technology, to develop and express 
informed judgments concerning complex topics. In the process, pTA deepens the social 
and ethical analysis of technology, complementing the expert-analytic and stakeholder-
advised approaches to TA used by the former OTA. European pTA methods have been 
adapted, tested and proven in the U.S. at least 16 times by university-based groups and 
independent non-profit organizations.  
• OTA reports were analytically rigorous and supplied extensive, in-depth and useful 
information. They provided Congress and the nation good value for the money. The OTA 
also had an oversight and pre-publication review process that ensured that studies were 
non-partisan 
o Slow delivery 
o Misleading presentation of objectivity 
o Uneven treatment of social consequences 
o Limited insight into synergisms and sociotechnological dynamics 
o No citizen perspective  
• Virtues of  Participatory Technology Assessment  
o Reasons to include laypeople in the TA methods are: 
  A matter of democratic right 
  Social values 
  Broader knowledge base 
  Cost reduction 
  Expedited conclusions 
• Criteria for a New U.S. Technology Assessment Capacity  
o Participation and Expertise 
o 21st-Century Structure 
o Continual Innovation in Concepts and Practices  
o Non=partisan Structure and Governance 
o Commitment to Transparent Process and Public Results 
• Practical Options for Establishing a 21st=Century TA Capability 
o One option: Congressional TA capability within GAO or other Congressional 
organization 
o Second option: Establish Expert & Citizen Assessment of Science & Technology 
(ECAST) network. This body would independent of government and comprise a 
complementary set of non-partisan policy research institutions, universities  
• Due to the changing pace of innovation in technology today, there is not a mechanism for 
understanding political costs and opportunities for innovation.  
o Without TA, citizens are often left to their own devices and the less obvious 
social ramifications of science and technology or practical alternatives are 
unknown until the technology is already entrenched. 
o With the introduction of the internet and Web 2.0 features, there are now 
opportunities for organizing TAs which make technology and science more 
transparent, publicly accessible, geographically distributed, collaborative and 
cost-effective. 
• European Advances 
o Danish style “consensus conference” – intended to provide policy-makers with a 
window into ordinary citizens’  considered opinions concerning emerging 
technological developments while also stimulating broad and intelligent social 
debate on technological issues 
o Additional pTA methods include: 
  Scenario workshops 
  Planning cells 
  Citizen hearings 
  Future search conferences  
  Development spaces  
  Deliberative mapping

The Role of Participatory Technology Assessment in Policy-
Making  
• In its essence, Technology Assessment (TA) has a strong political dimension. When the 
American Congress developed TA in the 70’s, it imagined a political instrument which 
would give to its members access to independent, objective and competent information 
on scientific and technological issues.  
• The American model was based on a rather scientific approach of the assessment 
(involving stakeholders only afterwards), European TA always struggled with how 
exactly to integrate interests and values in the assessment.  
• One strand of European TA – mainly originating in Denmark – is trying to solve the 
problem of how to make values and interests fruitful by organizing participatory 
procedures.  
• With this “participatory turn”, the political dimension of TA is even reinforced as it is no 
more an academic activity whose outcomes are to be communicated to and used by 
policy-makers, but a political activity itself. Integrating various actors is eminently 
political, as questions of power, influence and responsibility intervene. 
• New developments in science and technology put public authorities under stress as they 
are faced with uncertainty about the consequences of these developments and with a 
plurality of values and interests about them. Also our other theoretical lens, inequality, 
highlights the possible political contribution of pTA,  in particular to take into account 
the plurality of views and values present in society and to give them a voice.  
• pTA allows for:  
• Minority proposals are presented as viable solutions and get a chance to be accepted 
by the majority, too.  
• pTA can bring new ideas which will develop in time and generate further new ideas. 

In this respect, the role of pTA on the policy-making process is of a very special 
nature. 
• when assessing the role of pTA on the policy-making process, we must not forget that 
the actors intended to take up the results of the pTA do not always agree with its 
outcomes. PTA is always part of the political game in which power is at stake.
