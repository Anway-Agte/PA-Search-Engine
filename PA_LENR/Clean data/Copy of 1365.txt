1. INTRODUCTION

In 1989, Fleischmann and Pons observed that the output power much exceeded the input power
during electrolysis in heavy water solution containing Li ion so called the cold fusion [1]. More than 13
years has past since then and at the present time the experiments have been made not only in electrolysis, but
also glow discharge in gas, gas absorption and discharge in solids [2]-[4]. Various experimental results
were reported on such as nuclear products, transmutation (appearance of new elements on the surface of the
sample during experiments) as well as excess heat. Fleischmann used Pd as a cathode for electrolysis.
Recently materials that are used for cold fusion study are widely spread such as Ni, Ti, W, Pt, Au. However,
in many reports, excess heat and nuclear products were not clear and almost nothing, the reproducibility
was very poor .

The excess heat generation was reported not
only on heavy water electrolysis, but also light water
electrolysis. Patterson claimed large excess heat with high
reproducibility in light water electrolysis using multi layer
beads electrode created by chemical plating of Cu, Ni, Pd
and Ni on small synthetic resin balls (1mm diameter) by
means of reductant of hydrazine [5][6]. However, the
excess heat is not clear quantitatively, especially in related
to the reaction conditions.

In this paper, we have measured the heat balance
using Pd rods or Pd coated Ni(Pd/Ni) rods and balls in
light water electrolysis to investigate the reproducibility of
excess heat generation and establish the conditions of
reproducibility using Patterson type power cell [5]-[8].

2. EXPERIMENTAL

Figure 1 shows the cylindrical electrolysis cell made of acrylic resin. The inner and outer
diameter are 3cm, 5cm and the height is 10cm. The distance between the anode and the cathode is about
2mm. Pt mesh (3cmφ, 55mesh) and Pd coated Ni (Pd/Ni) rods (1mmφ×2mm, 500 pieces) were used for
the cathode, Pt mesh (3cmφ, 55mesh) was used for the anode in most experiments. In some cases, Pd rods,
Pd coated Ni (Pd/Ni) balls (1mmφ, 1000 pieces), Pd sputtered Ni (Pd/Ni) rods and Pd sputtered Ni (Pd/Ni)
balls (1mmφ, 1000pieces) were also used. The most Pd/Ni samples were prepared by chemical plating
method. The plating bath consists of palladium chloride (0.01 mol dm-1), ethylenediamine (0.08 mol dm-1),
thiodiglycolic acid (30 mg dm-1) and sodium phosphate (0.02 mol dm-1). After adjusting the plating bath
to pH 7, Ni rods (1000 pieces) or Ni balls (2000 pieces) were dipped in the bath (300 ml) for 3 hours with
stirring.

In some cases, Pd/Ni samples were prepared by sputtering. The Ni rods and balls were cleaned in
acetone and then in 2N HNO3. The Pd layer was deposited on the substrate under Ar atmosphere (5.0*10-1
Pa), after evacuation to 10-4 Pa. The purity of Pd was 99.9%. The Ni rods and balls were set in a spherical
and mesh basket. The sputtering was performed on power of 100W for 10 min, rotating the basket with 3
rpm. The Cu leading wire was covered with heat shrinkable tube. The leading wire and Pt mesh were
connected by a sputter welding. 1M Li2SO4-H2O solution was circulated in this system passing through a
reservoir. The temperature of electrolyte in the reservoir was kept at 298K. The plastic beads were put on
the upper part of the cathode to prevent the cathode from floating under circulation of electrolyte and
generation of gas by electrolysis. The electrolysis was conducted mostly at 1A, in some cases, 0.5-2A and
0.8A. The flow rate of electrolyte was fixed at 45 ml min-1. The gas generated during electrolysis was
collected in the reservoir. The rate of gas generation was measured using a soap membrane flow meter and
used to correct heat balance. The temperature difference of electrolyte was measured by a Pt resistance
thermometer placed at the cell inlet and outlet. The data was recorded every three minites in a personal
computer through a data logger. For several hours before electrolysis, we measured temperature difference
dT0W between the cell inlet and outlet circulating electrolyte to correct for data of heat balance. The heat
balance was calculated by the following equations.

WIN = I・V (1)

WOUT = FR(dT-dT0W)Cpd + H (2)

HB = WOUT/WIN (3)

, where WIN (W) and WOUT (W) are the input power and the output power, FR is the flow rate of
electrolyte (ml s-1), dT0W (K) is the temperature difference between the cell inlet and outlet before the
electrolysis, dT (K) is temperature difference between cell
inlet and outlet, Cp is the heat capacity of electrolyte
(298K) estimated 0.91(J K-1 g-1) and d is the density of
electrolyte estimated 1.087 (g cm-3). HB is the heat
balance obtained from the ratio of WOUT to WIN.
In measurement of the heat capacity, we used a
DSC. The bottom of the silver vessel was polished by
emery paper (#1500) to improve heat conduction between
the holder and the vessel. This measurement was
conducted between 273K (0oC) and 323K (50oC) with a
heating rate of 1K min-1. Figure 2 shows a DSC change
with temperature, where Ys is the difference of DSC
between the empty and the sample vessels and Yr is the
difference of DSC between the empty and the standard
sample containing ultra pure water. On the basis of
these data, we obtain the heat capacity of 1M
Li2SO4-H2O at 293K using the following equation,

Cps=Cpr・(mr・Ys)/(Yr・ms) (4)

Fig. 2 Heat capacity measurement of 1M
Li2SO4 light water solution by DSC.

where Cps is the heat capacity of the sample(1M Li2SO4 aqueous), Cpr is the heat capacity of the standard
sample (ultra pure water), ms and mr are the weight of a sample and a standard sample, respectively. From
this calculation, the heat capacity of 0.91 J K-1 g-1 was obtained for 1M Li2SO4 aqueous solution at 293K.

This experimental system is open to atmosphere and generated gases (H2, O2) are released outside
of the system. Since the gases generated by electrolysis of water, the enthalpy change of 286KJ mol-1
should be considered. If only the first term in equation (2) is considered, the input energy would not be
recovered completely, because the effect of gas generation can not be ignored. Therefore we measured the
flow rate of gas that released outside of system during electrolysis, so that we could obtain heat balance
correctly by compensating the amount of energy for the decomposition of water in the second term H (W) of
equation (2). The term, H (W) is given below,

H = 2324 Pair FR’/T (5)

where Pair (atm) is the atmospheric pressure, FR’(ml s-1) is the flow rate of evolved gas, T (K) is the
temperature of the reservoir.


3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Table 1 shows the heat balance using Pd coated Ni rods for cathode in 1M Li2SO4 aqueous
solution. The averaged heat balance more than 1 was observed in most runs. Especially, No.1, 3, 5, 7, 23,
24 showed the large excess heat (more than 10%).

No.8 whose run time was for 54.75h at 1A, showed small excess heat, i.e. less than 10%. The run
time is 54.75h. Figure3 shows the change of cell voltage with time. The cell voltage was about 10V at the
beginning of electrolysis and decreased gradually to
8.4V. After 10 hours the voltage was kept constant.
Figure 4 shows the trend of temperature difference
between the cell inlet and outlet. The temperature
difference was about 3.11K at the beginning of
electrolysis and decreased gradually to about 2.5K at
10 hours. The temperature difference became
constant after 10 hours. Behavior of the
temperature change was almost corresponding to the
change of cell voltage. The averaged flow rate of
electrolyte was 43.09 ± 0.14 ml min-1
and the averaged rate of gas evolution was 11.37±0.46 ml
min-1. The averaged current efficiency was 94±

0.9%. The current efficiency was obtained by the rate of gas evolution and from these result, 94% of
evolved gas was found releasing to outside of the system and 6% was recombined.

The heat balance was calculated from equation (3), after substituting these result to equation (2).
Figure 5 shows the heat balance. The heat balance was a little high value at the beginning of electrolysis,
but the heat balance was about 1.01 after 10 hours. It is difficult to evaluate this value as the excess heat
generation because this excess heat is within the standard deviation.

Figure 6 shows the example of trend of the cell voltage under large excess heat of more than 10%
(No.7). The cell voltage was about 9.2V at the beginning of electrolysis, and decreased gradually to 7.5V at
1A range (0-50h) and decreased from 10.5V to 9V in 2A range (50-70.05h). At 0.5A range (70.05-94.1h)
and 1A range (94.1-123.3h), the cell voltage was kept almost constant, i.e. 4.8V, 6.2V, respectively.

Figure 7 shows the trend of temperature difference
between the cell inlet and outlet. The temperature
difference decreased from 5.3K to 3.3K at 1A range
(0-50h), decreased from 8.7K to 6.6K at 2A range
(50-70.05h). At 0.5A range (70.05-94.1h) and 1A
range (94.1-123.3h), the temperature difference was
kept almost constant, i.e. 0.9K, 2.39K, respectively.
The flow rate of electrolyte was 42.93±0.07 ml
min-1. The rate of gas evolution under electrolysis
was 11.07±0.68 ml min-1 at 1A range (0-50A),
21.04±0.97 ml min-1 at 2A range (50-70.05h), 5.52
±0.29 ml min-1 at 0.5A range (70.05-94.1h), 11.17
±0.38 ml min-1 at 1A range (94.1-123.3h). The
current efficiency was 91.2% (1A), 86.8% (2A),
91.1% (0.5A), 92.0% (1A), respectively. The term
of correction H(W) was 1.43±0.09W at 1A range
(0-50h), 2.73±0.13W at 2A range (50-70.05h), 0.72
±0.04W at 0.5A range (70.05-94.1h), 1.45±0.05W
at 1A range (94.1-123.3h).

From the above data, the heat balance was
obtained to be 1.50±0.08 at 1A range, 1.29±0.05 at
2A range, 1.41±0.10 at 0.5A range, 1.37±0.07 at 1A range, respectively. Figure 8 shows the trend of
averaged heat balance. We got the excess heat even without the correction of the current efficiency. The
maximum of the averaged heat balance in these experiments was 1.84 and the minimum was 1.25. The
maximum of the excess heat in these experiments was 7.8W (input 9.3W, output 17.1W) and the integrated
excess heat generation was 1.5MJ. If this heat is generated in Pd layer on Ni rods, the energy density would
be 1985W cm-3 Pd and in the case of Pd/Ni rods, the energy density would be 9.9W cm-3 Pd/Ni.


4.CONCLUSION

In this study, we observed the excess heat using Pd/Ni or Pd rods in 6 runs. However, in most of
other runs, only the small excess or no excess was shown. We cannot say clearly the excess heat with the
5% excess, since the error limit of our system was 8-10%. In order to confirm the excess heat we have to
elucidate the reason why these differences are between large excess and no excess.
