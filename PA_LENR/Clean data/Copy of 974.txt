1. Introduction

In the experiments conducted with deuterium, the measurement of neutrons,
attributed to the reaction

D +D= 3He+n (1)

and therefore with energy of 2,45 MeV, has presented difficulties since the very first
experiments in 1989 due to the scarcity and/or irregularity of the emission.

The fact that the neutron emission is weak even when the excess heat is rather high
compels us to suppose that (1) holds true, however, in a minority of reactions; it seems
therefore necessary to consider separate the cause of the heat and that of the neutrons.

The reaction could be different from (1) : Takahashi[2] has measured neutron
emissions at energy between 3 and 7 MeV; Karabut [3] has obtained neutrons with
energy up to 17 MeV from glow discharge in deuterium and, recently,
Manduchi/Mengoli[4] have observed neutron emission (of energies> 2.45 MeV) from
application of d.c current to Pd deuteride. In the electrolysis of D20 in presence of
tritium Stukan[5] has observed hard neutrons ascribable to the cold fusion T +D.

Although experiments have been reported in which the emission appears constant
in time [6•9], irregularity is the most frequent characteristic of neutron production in
cold fusion: the neutrons are often grouped in bursts of varied composition and
duration. 


2. Neutrons 1989-1995

Subsequently to the first communications of 1989 many groups have detected 
neutron intensities well above the background. We limit ourselves to an 
exemplification of experiences in which neutron generation is many times the statistical 
error cr8 on background.

ELECTROLYTIC LOADING: 
Measurement of reaction neutrons - Neutron spectrometry presents difficulties with 
this type of loading, because the electrolytic solution and the possible thermostatic bath 
slow down the neutrons. However, Takahashi[2] in pulsed electrolysis with a heavy
water LiOD solution has measured neutron emissions at 2.45 MeV (but also at energy 
between 3 and 7 MeV). 

Measurement of neutrons after thermalization - Sanchez[10], during heavy water
electrolysis with a Ti cathode has measured for several hours, with a BF3 detector, 
counting rates up to 105 n/s . Palibroda[1 1] has worked in electrolysis with a palladium
cathode and a solution with an addition of thiourea; various neutron emissions have 
been recorded which, after thermalization, reached 300 times the background and lasted 
up to 12 hours. Fujii[12] has worked with a 0.1 mol/dm3 LiOD solution in heavy water.
Utilizing 3He counters he has found neutron bursts up to 135 cr8.

GASEOUS LOADING: 
Measurement of reaction neutrons - Botta/Bressani[13] have applied a time of flight
spectrometer to the Ti/D system; neutrons of 2.45 Me V energy have been found in the 
excess of 5 cr8 compared to the background. Manduchi/Mengoli[14] have utilized the 
technique of gaseous loading of deuterium on Pd with decreasing temperature from 
900°C to 20°C. The neutron measurement was effected with a NE213 ( 100 cm3) 
spectrometer; significant quantities of neutrons have been observed especially in the 
temperature intervals in which the deuterium was more actively absorbed by the metal. 
Neutrons also are produced following loading with natural hydrogen. 

Measurement of neutrons after thermalization - Manduchi/Mengoli[15] have, among
other things, sought confirmation of Scaramuzzi's experiment of 1989, by producing 
many cycles of deuterium charging and discharging on titanium: for about two weeks 
they periodically found neutron emission, measured as thermals, for approximately 10 
times cr8_ 

ELECTRIC DISCHARGES IN DEUTERIUM GAS: 
This type of experiment, already begun in 1989[16, 17], appears efficacious in the
production of neutrons, but the reaction rate is not in general sufficient to produce a 
measurable excess heat. Only in the work of Kucherov[18], favorably characterized also
by the maximum neutron emission (with activation of 107 Ag and 109 Ag) related to
the minimum d.d.p. employed (< 500 V) , have 50 W been appreciated. 

Long[19] experimented with the glow discharge between Pd-deuterated electrodes,
obtaining reactions in the metallic film deposited on the glass of the bulb. The 
neutrons, measured with a recoil-proton scintillation detector, reached the average rate 
of several hundred per second. With metals other than Pd the neutrons were more 
numerous (104 n/s) and long-lasting, so much so as allow the radioactivation of indium 
and iridium. 

DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES AND/ OR MATERIALS: 
Lyakhov[20] has found that the combined action of cavitation and electrolysis on a 
titanium surface determines a reproducible neutron emission (0.6 n/s) with bursts of 103
n/ms. 

Bittner[21] employs a mixed method, in that it involves electrolytic deuteration of 
palladium and subsequent degassing through heating; the emission of neutrons ( of 
approximately 2.5 MeV) took place mainly during the degassing phase, at high 
temperature, for about an hour. 

The Piantelli's technique [22,23], which uses natural hydrogen, allows a generation
of> 106 n/s (radioactivity was induced in Au,In and Mn) besides of significant 
anomalous excess heat. Then this "Siena experiment" [24,25,26] is to be considered as the 
most sure acknowledgement, up to date, of the nuclear cold fusion hypotesis. 

Manduchi-Mengoli [4] have founded strong neutron emission (30+40 n/s) correlated 
with the migration of deuterium; the energy was> 2.45 MeV for 80% of the total. 

Wada[27] reports emission of 2.45 MeV neutron bursts with temperature rise from 
palladium by means od simple exposure to D2 gas in a closed glass bulb. 


3. Transmutations

The finding of particular nuclides might be an indirect signal that neutron
generation has taken place. 

Coupland[28] reports that in the superficial layers of Pd electrodes the isotopic ratio 
6Li/7Li appeared very reduced (from 0.08 to less than 0.05) after having been used by 
Pons and Fleishmann. The anomaly may be interpreted as the consequence of reactions 
of the 6Li with thermal neutrons whose cross section (n,a), as is known, is very large 
(945 barn). 

Other nuclides are presumably created by the transmutation of species originally 
composing the crystalline lattice. Rollison[29], in mass-spectrometric observations of the 
deuterated Pd, has found an increase (from 27 % to 40 %) in the abundance of the 106Pd 
isotope (1°5Pd abundance undergoes a corresponding reduction). 

Karabut [3] has measured a y-ray emission attributed to io9mpd (T 112
= 4.7 min). 
Recently the production of silver has been observed, in particular by Dash[30], who 
believes that the 108Pd (n,y)109Pd capture has taken place followed by decay into stable 
109 Ag , with half life T 112 = 13.7 h. Obviously also the original impurities (for example
Ag, Au and Pt) as well as the Pt of the anode, transferred in part onto the cathode in the 
course of experiments of electrolytic loading, may undergo transmutations[31]. In 
particular 196Pt (relative abundance 25.3% in the natural element) through reaction (n,y) 
would give place to 197Pt which would become stable 197 Au after beta decay. 


4. What activates the neutron channel ?

The examination of the works mentioned so far does not seem yet to furnish a 
final evidence about what could be the modes which activate the neutron channel, but in 
many cases non-equilibrium conditions appear necessary; the temperature seems 
important. 

Loading ratio - It is known that many experiments indicate for Pd a loading ratio 
x = 0.85 as the threshold for the production of excess heat; for neutrons some authors 
have reported as useful decidedly inferior values. Shani[32] sealed the Pd sample 
destined to emit neutrons when the D/Pd ratio had been brought to a value of .6. In 
addition Long has indicated the condition x > .3, while from Bittner's graphs[21]
neutrons still seem to be emitted when, during degassing, the ratio had been reduced to 
about .66. Iwamura[33], who with 3He detectors observes neutron emission during
degassing, claims to load to the maximum value of x = .66, while Nakada[34] recognizes
a requisite value of x=.77 and, lately, Garg[35] has indicated useful x values from 0.4 to
0.7 in a variety of gas loading experiments. :

For Dffi systems Alguer6[36] recommends the critical value x=l.95, which is attained
in only a thin layer close to surface (few microns) during D20 electrolysis. 

Stratifications - In the Iwamura's and Alguer6's experiments the phenomena seem to 
concentrate on the deposited superficial layer. Other experiments, as well, seem to 
indicate that the generative processes of neutrons are produced in correspondence to 
thin stratifications. 
Nakada[37] has proved that the formation of Pd-Li layers in the
surface region favours the anomalous deuterium accumulation, with neutron emission. 

Catalytic hypotheses - Some researchers affirm that the stochastic character of the 
emissions of neutron bursts suggests a catalytic nature, for which such episodes may be 
induced by neutrons or by other particles of the environmental background. From such 
a viewpoint the experiment described by Shani[32] seems interesting: in a high­
neutron background environment ( 0.05 counts/s/cm2 ) a 2.45 MeV neutron peak was 
observed, while in a low background environment (0.0002 counts/s/cm2) there was no
peak. The idea of catalysis is sustained also by Gluck [38] and by Kozima[39] who
adduces as a clue the fact that the phenomena of cold fusion appear markedly less 
frequent in heavily shielded environments. 


5. Conclusions

Neutrons were observed in many laboratories. The most frequently measured
neutron energy is 2.45 Me V of the D+D reaction; reported higher energies need further 
confirmations. The isotopic shifts would also deserve careful examination. 

Experiments seem to support the firm belief that excess heat is generated by 
principales nuclear events accompanied by less frequent reactions which produce 
neutrons.
