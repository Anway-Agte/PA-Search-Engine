THE EFFECT OF VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION
AND ELECTRON SCREENING ON COLD FUSION  Robert A. Rice, Gary S. Chulick, and Yeong E. Kim


ABSTRACT


It is demonstrated that electron screening, in
combination with a particle velocity distribution,
greatly enhances the cross sections and reaction rates
for deuteron-deuteron (D-D) and proton-deuteron
('Jr D) fusion for low kinetic energies ( E :S 20 e V,
center of mass frame). 'Jr D fusion rates are shown to
be comparable to D-D fusion rates for E ~ l0 eV, so
that in electrolysis experiments with equal amounts
of H and D, 'frD fusion should compete with D-D
fusion as a reaction mechanism.


I. INTRODUCTION

Recently, the effect of a velocity distribution [l]
in the context of a surface reaction mechanism [2,3]
was shown to be very important in reducing the discrepancy
between the electrolysis fusion results [4-9]
and the conventional estimates [10-11] of cold fusion
rates. More recently, it has been suggested [12] that
the effect of electron screening may become significant
at low energies and further reduce the discrepancy.
In this paper, we present results of our detailed
calculations of the deuterium-deuterium (DD)
and proton-deuterium ('JrD) fusion rates including
both a velocity distribution and electron screening.
In section II, definitions and expressions for the
Coulomb barrier penetration factor, fusion cross sections
and fusion rates are described. In section III,
the calculated results are presented and discussed.
Finally, section IV contains conclusions.


II. THEORETICAL FORMULATION

Three dominant fusion reactions occurring at low
energies are Reaction (la) is not a "real" fusion reaction but a
neutron-transfer reaction, while reaction ( 1 b) is a. fusion
reaction in which two protons are fused to form
a 3 He nucleus. Because of the complexity of the
four-nucleon system, no rigorous theoretical calculations
of the D-D fusion rates and branching ratios
and of the H-D fusion rates have been carried out
at low positive energies. Since there are no direct
measurements of the fusion cross sections, a(E), for
reactions (la) and (lb), below ED 􀃜 4 keV (laboratory
(LAB) frame), and for reaction (le) below
EH 􀃜 24 keV (LAB), a(E) has to be extrapolated
using the measured values of a( E) at higher energies
as is conventionally done in astrophysical calculations
[13,14] for kT 􀃝 1.5 keV. In our case, an
extrapolation down to the order of 10 eV is required.
We describe in the discussion below the extrapolation
method used in the astrophysical calculations
[13,14] which assumes equal branching ratios for reactions
(la) and (lb). In the following, a theoretical
formulation will be given in detail only for reactions
(la) and (lb), as it is similar to that for reaction
(le).


II.I. Velocity Distribution

Since the precise form of the D+ velocity distribution
in electrolysis experiments is not known at
present, we will assume a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
with and without a cut-off for high velocity
components. The temperature term, kBT, will be replaced
by the "average" kinetic energy, Evv, in the
center of mass (CM) D-D frame, which is related to
the most probable velocity v (CM) by EvD = 􀀂 v2
(CM) with the reduced mass M = Mv/2. 

the D-D fusion rate, A (sec-1 / D-D pair), for reaction
(la) or (lb) is given by [13,14] with where the cross section, a(E), has been parameterized
as [13]
a( which is the conventional form assuming (la), (lb),
and (le) are non-resonant charged particle reactions.
Ea is the "Gamow energy" given by Ea =
(21raZvZv) 2 Mc2 /2 or Ea::::: 31.39 (keV) 1 l2 with
the reduced mass M::::: Mv/2 for reactions (la) and
(lb) and E::J2 = 25.64 (keV)1 12 for reaction (le)
with the reduced mass M = mpMv/(mp + Mv):::::
Mv/3. E is in units of keV in the center of mass
(CM) reference frame. The S-factor, S(E), is extracted
from the experimentally measured values
[15,16] of the cross section, a(E), for E ;:, 4 keV
and is nearly constant [13,16], S(E)::::: 52.9 keV - b,
for both reactions (la) and ( 1 b) in the energy range
of interest here, E :S 1 keV. For reaction (le),
S(E) ::::: 2.50 x 10-4 keV - b [13]. The deuterium
density nv is assumed to be ~ 6 x 1022 cm-3
. Ee in
eq. (3) is the upper integration limit beyond which
the high velocity components are cut off. With a
Taylor series expansion of S( E) [13]
S(E)::::: S(O) + S'(O)E + 􀀇 S"(O)E2
, (5)
the integral in eq. (3) can be carried out numerically

For a sharp velocity distribution, which has been used in the argument against the possibility of D- as D fusion at room temperature, the D-D fusion rate
(sec-1 / D-D pair), A6, is given by  where E = Evv = Af v2 (CM) = 􀀆 v2(LAB) =
½ Ev(LAB), and a(E) is from eq. (4).


II.2. Electron Screening Effect

In electrolysis fusion experiments and other fusion
processes, D+ is incident on D, which is shielded by electron clouds and is electrically neutral outside
the electron screening range, r., . The expression for
a(E) given by eq. ( 4) is derived for the case in which
one D+ is incident on another n + . Therefore, the
Coulomb barrier penetration factor ( "Gamow factor")
in eq. ( 4)
Pa(E) = exp (-(Ea/ E)1 l2) (7)
is appropriate only for the ( D+ + n+ ) reaction and
needs to be modified for the case of ( D+ + D) in reactions
(la) and (lb), and for the case of (D+ + H) in
reaction (le). The modified Coulomb barrier penetration
factor, Pa (E), is the probability of tunneling
through the barrier to reach the nuclear surface and
can be computed from solutions of the Schroedinger
equation for a (D+ + D) system in which an attractive
Coulomb potential Va ( r) due to the presence of
shielding electrons is included with the original repulsive
Coulomb potential between two D+ 's ( two
protons).

The modified Coulomb barrier penetration factor,
P., (E), which includes the effect of Va (r),
can be calculated in the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin
(WKB) approximation as  where Ve ( r) is the repulsive Coulomb potential between
two D+ 's, and Va ( r) is the potential due to the shielding electrons.
The effective nuclear interaction range, TN :::::
BF (twice the deuteron radius), can be set to zero in
eq. (8) without loss of accuracy. The integral in eq.
(8) cannot be carried out analytically in general, but can be written for an attractive potential, Va( r) < O, where E.,(E) is determined by carrying out the integral
numerically for each value of E > 0. The
modified penetration factor, P., (E), is then given by cWonhveenn Vti.o(nra) l= G 0a,m Eo.w(E f)a cvtaonri,s hPe.s(,E a)n d=: wPea r(eEco)v, egri vthene

given in reference 13 are used in eq. (18). The calculated
results for ann(Env) and Ann(Evv) are
plotted as functions of Evv :-:; 20 eV in Figs. 1
and 2, respectively; Anv(Evn) is for the sum of
reactions (la) and ( 1 b), assuming equal branching
ratios. In evaluating Ann(Evn), the cut-off energy
Ee in eq. (3) is assumed to be infinite. The case
where Ea
= 0 in Figs. 1 and 2 corresponds to the
use of the conventional Gamow factor, eq. (7), as
in eq. ( 4). As can be seen from Figs. 1 and 2, the
electron screening effect ( E 6 i- 0) becomes increasingly
significant for avv(Evv) and Avv(Evv) for
reactions (la) and (lb), as Evv decreases below 20
eV.

distribution,
we calculate the fusion rates A6(Evn) with
a sharp ( delta function) velocity distribution using
eq. ( 6) for reactions ( 1 a) and ( 1 b). The calculated
results for A6( Env) with Ea = 0, 4, and 10 e2 / a0 are
plotted and compared in Fig. 3 with the corresponding
cases of Avn(Evv) with a Maxwell-Boltzmann
velocity distribution. As can be seen from comparing
A6 and Avv in Fig. 3, the effect of the velocity
distribution becomes increasingly important as Evv
decreases, but is less so as Ea increases for reactions
(la) and (lb).

To study the effect of introducing a high-energy
cut-off (Ee in eq. (3)) for the Maxwell-Boltzmann
velocity distribution, we calculate the fusion rates
Avv(Evv) of eq. (2) for the sum of reactions (la)
and (lb) as a function of Ee for the cases Evv = 5
and 10 eV with Ea
= 0, 4, and 10 e2 /ao in eq. (18).
The calculated results are plotted in Fig. 4. As can
be seen from Fig. 4, the effect of a cut-off in the
velocity distribution is substantially less for the case
of Ea
= 10 e2 /ao than for the case of Ea
= 0 (no
electron screening effect).

For reaction (le), we calculate the fusion cross
section and rates, apv(Epn) and Apn(EpD), using
eqs. (18) and (2), respectively, with the replacements
of nn/2 in eq. (2) and M and Evv in eq.
(3) by nH, M = mp Mv/(mp + Mn) ::::; Mn/3,
and Ep v( CM), respectively. Parametric values of - 2 Ea = 0, 1, 4, and 10 e /ao are used. nH is assumed
to be nH = nn = 6 x 1022 cm -3, and the
parametric values for S(E) for reaction (le) given in
reference 13 are used in eq. (18). Ee in eq. (3) is
set to infinity. The calculated results for apv(Epn)
and Apv( EpD) are plotted in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively.
The Ea = 0 case in Figs. 5 and 6 corresponds
to the use of the conventional Gamow factor, (la) and (lb) (Figs. 1 and 2), the electron screening
effect (.it -:J 0) becomes substantial for CTpD(EpD)
and ApD ( EpD) at very low energies.

te
with reactions (la) and ( 1 b) in electrolysis experiments,
we compare ApD(EpD) and ADD(EDD)
in Fig. 7 for the cases it = 0 and 10 e2 / a0. As
can be seen from Fig. 7, ApD(EpD) is comparable to
ADD(EDD) for the case (.E, -:J 0) and nH = nD ,
Therefore, for a typical value of the H / D ratio,
nH /nD 􀃭 10-3, in electrolysis experiments, reactions
( 1 a) and ( 1 b) will dominate over reaction ( 1 c).
However, reaction (le) can compete with reactions
(la) and (lb) if nH 􀃭 nD is maintained in electrolysis
experiments.


IV. CONCLUSIONS

It is shown that the effect of electron screening
in conjunction with a particle velocity distribution
greatly enhances the cross sections and reaction rates
for D-D and p-D fusion at kinetic energies E 􀀍
20 eV (CM).

xp(la) 􀃭 10-19 sec-1, inferred by Fleischmann
et al. [4] from the measurement of tritium production,
and also the D-D fusion rate for reaction
(lb), A􀃫xp(la) 􀃭 10-23 sec-1, obtained by Jones
et al. [5] are often criticized as being impossible
or incorrect when compared to estimates of A in
bulk matter (an upper limit of A 􀃬 10-47 sec-1)
[10] or to the result of A6 shown in Fig. 3 (lowest
curve). Our results for A (upper curves) shown
in Fig. 3 indicate A􀃫xp(lb) 􀃭 10-23 sec-1 [5] and
A[xp(lb) 􀃭 10-19 sec-1 [4] are consistent with calculated
values of ADD(EDD) 􀃭 10-23 sec-1 and
ADD(EDD ) 􀃭 10-19 sec-1 for EDD 􀃭 10 eV and
17 eV, respectively, with E, = 4e2jao. Therefore,
the claimed values of A􀃫xp( lb) and Aexp( la) are physically
acceptable values for the D-D fusion rate in
electrolysis experiments if the applied potentials are
20 V and 34 V, respectively.

To match the D-D fusion rate ADD(EDD) from
eq. (la) to the rate, A􀃮;;t(la) 􀃭 10-10 sec-1 (4] inferred
from excess heat measurements [3,5,6], an "ave-
rage" kinetic energy of EDD 􀃭 70 eV- is need2e d with E, = 4 e2 /a0, or EDD< 70 eV for E, > 4 e /ao.

The calculated p-D fusion rates ApD( EpD) for reaction
(le) are comparable to the D-D fusion rates
for reactions (la) and (le) with E, = 10 e2 /a0 and EpD(and EDD)< 20 eV as shown in Fig. 7. Therefore,
p-D fusion can compete with D-D fusion if an
H / D ratio of nH /nD 􀃭 l can be maintained in both
the H20-D20 mixture and the Pd cathode during
electrolysis fusion experiments.
