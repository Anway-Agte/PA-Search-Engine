Prior to coming to the LBJ School
Enjoyed a long & enjoyable career in the environmental field
Don’t propose to be presenting much (if anything) new to give 
this morning
Rather, assemble information in a way that might (just maybe) 
provide an avenue out of the wilderness for CF
This presentation is different from others on the agenda
Nevertheless a topic of much potential interest among CF 
researchers


Public Policy toward Cold Fusion: Approach

1. Focus on the Public Interest in Cold 
Fusion
2. Assess CF policy in Evidence-Based
framework
3. Delineate 5 Levels of Evidence in rational 
framework
4. Consider evidence of CF specifically

Public Policy toward Cold Fusion: Approach
6. Propose 2 policy response scenarios –
conservative & moderate
7. Conclude risk not a major consideration in 
relation to reward – public benefit
8. Postulate Level of Evidence for CF 
existence and associated public policy 
response

Self explanatory slide


Policy Toward Cold Fusion: 

What Should It Be?
• Private Sector
– $ incentives
– Market forces
– Intellectual property 
considerations
• Public Sector
– The Public Interest


What should the policy for development of CF be?

Private sector has its set of answers
Public sector, on the other hand, has a different answer: the 
PUBLIC INTEREST
I will be referring back to this concept or value frequently in 
this talk


The Public Interest in CF Is Well Established…

• Excess heat: energy source
• Transmutation of elements?
• New area of science (physics): unknown 
future benefits
Self explanatory slide


How Should Public Policy Be Determined?

• Grounded in the Public Interest
• Set in rational policy making frame-
work
• Based on level of evidence of CF 
existence
• Balancing risk and reward of CF 
support

Self explanatory slide


Evidence-Based Policy Making Framework

• Not ideological
• Return to rational basis of public 
policy
• Reaction to Post-Modern trend?
• Pragmatic: what works!
• Started in medicine
• Extended to other fields
– Education
– Management
– Social welfare
– Public policy making
Evidence-based Policy Making represents a resurgence of the 
rational (Modern) point of view and value system for the Public 
Interest


Levels of Evidence

• Lesser levels of evidence…
– Low probability
– Medium probability
• Borrowing from the legal field…
– Preponderance of evidence
– Clear and convincing evidence
– Beyond a reasonable doubt
Levels of Evidence postulated for this investigation


Evidence for CF Existence

• Scientific Evidence
– Early Confirmations (Beaudette, 2002)
– Affirmations, 1989-2004 (Storms, 2007)
– Most Convincing Experiments (WIP)
• Probabilistic Evidence (Melich, 2007)
– P(A|BC)
– A: Low-Temperature Nuclear Reactions  
B: Excess Heat  
C: Radiation
That is, what is the Evidence of CF Reality?
Start with Scientific evidence.
Looked at from 3 angles
Early corroborations…
Affirmations since then…
Perhaps also most convincing experiments (a Work 
in Progress)
We can also look at other kinds of evidence
For example, the very interesting probabilistic 
analysis presented by Michael Melich at Catania in 
Reached a conclusion of 97% probability 


Early Confirmation (Excess Heat)

Miles, Huggins
Beaudette, “Excess Heat”, 2002
Excess heat indicated
Excess heat indicated
Miles
Plot of ratio of output power to input power
Excess power began on Day 4
Reached a maximum of 1.3 (30% excess) on Day 11
Continued to end of experiment
Huggins
Excess power (% over input power) began at ~45 min
Reached a maximum of 55% excess power at 55 min
Continued until 95 min
Temperature rise noted in same timeframe

Early Confirmation (Excess Heat)

McKubre, Oriani
Excess heat indicated
Excess heat indicated
Beaudette, “Excess Heat”, 2002
McKubre
Excess power initiated on Day 53 of experiment and 
continued through Day 65
Experimentally initiated by increasing current on Day 53
Excess power of about 0.9 watts observed
Oriani
Plot of power in vs power out
Input and output balance indicated by diagonal line
Total of eight points (six more definitive) above the line
Strong indication of excess heat where heat output 
exceeds input


Under most circumstances…

Early confirmations would have been 
sufficient for scientific acceptance.
But not for CF…
What about since then?
Self explanatory slide


Confirmations, 1989-2004
Assembled from Table 2, p. 53-61
Remarkable 184 corroborations of excess heat since early 
confirmations.


Confirmations, 1989-2004 
Similarly remarkable 68 corroborations of radiation since early 
confirmations.


Most Convincing Experiments

(Work in Progress)
• The list of candidates is long…
– McKubre?
– Mizuno?
– Storms?
– SPAWAR?
– Oriani?
– Others?
• Criterion: Clearest evidence to support 
rational policy making
Selection of Most Convincing Experiments for Policy Makers 
still needs to be accomplished.


Probabilistic Analysis of CF Reality

• Computed conditional probability of A, given observation 
of B and C: P(A|BC)
– A: Nuclear reactions at low temperatures
– B: Excess heat (B)
– C: Emission of energetic particles (C)
– Conducted analysis using Bayes’ Theorem and Bayesian 
network
– Made reasonable estimates of probability of the nodes of the 
Bayesian network
• Result: P(A|BC) = 0.971 ~ 97%
– Qualifier: demonstration of approach only 
– Melich not ready to “stand behind” the probability estimates

CF Evidence: Summary

• Four excellent examples of early 
confirmation
• Numerous confirmations since
• Many excellent candidates for highly 
convincing experiments
• Early probabilistic analysis very positive
Self explanatory slide


Taking the analysis to the
next step…

What should the policy 
responses toward CF be?
1. Conservative Scenario
2. Moderate Scenario
Two scenarios set forth….


Policy Responses to Levels of Evidence 
Conservative Policy Scenario

Five responses for five levels of evidence…
Low 
Discontinue Research
Medium
Business as Usual
PoE
Reinstate
CCE
Hot Fusion Support
BRD
Manhattan Project
Five Policy Responses postulated for first time in this 
investigation – Conservative scenario


Policy Responses to Levels of Evidence 

Moderate Policy Scenario
Move responses up by one level…
Low 
Business as Usual
Medium
Reinstate
PoE
Hot Fusion Support
CCE
Manhattan Project
BRD
Manhattan Project+
Similar Policy Responses – Moderate Scenario
Responses move up one level.


Conclusion: What is the 
Level of Evidence for CF?

• Based on:
– Scientific evidence (3 lines)
– Preliminary probabilistic analysis
• LoE is at least PoE (50-70%)
• Strong case can be made for CCE (70-90%)
• Perhaps not (yet) for BRD (>90%)
Bold Assertion! Preponderance of Evidence for existence (reality) of CF 
phenomenon


Summary: What Is the Policy 
Response to CF Evidence?
Policy Scenario
Conservative
Moderate
Medium:10-50% Business as Usual Reinstate
PoE: 50-70%
Reinstate
Hot Fusion
CCE: 70-90%
Hot Fusion
Manhattan Project
Given the high level of public interest in the success of CF…
Self explanatory review slide – conclusions presented another way.


Finally, What About Reward vs Risk?

• Reward (CF real): Public 
Interest well established!
• Risk (CF real): Any?
• Risk (CF not real): Not 
much…
– Possible wasted public funds
– Diversion of support from 
competing areas?
• Conclusion: risk not a major consideration
• Risk greatly outweighed by potential rewards
Many argue that CF is a low-risk investigation area. This slide shows 
why.
Risk of CF reality not shown: reputation of antagonists and how CF 
treatment did not follow scientific method


Summary

•Assert CF Level of Evidence…
At least PoE (50-70%)
Maybe even CCE (70-90%)
•
Conclude policy response…
Conservative
Moderate
PoE: Reinstate
Hot fusion level
CCE: Hot fusion level
Manhattan Project
Self explanatory slide – the bottom line
CF must be at least reinstated, even supported on a par with hot fusion


Next Steps

• “Full-blown” Policy Analysis: path forward 
(Fall 2008)
– Focus on Public Interest, rational policy 
making
– Also on reconciliation and recovery (in the 
Public Interest)
• Initiate process for comprehensive, 
integrated research plan 
• Begin consideration of secondary impacts 
(technology assessment?)
